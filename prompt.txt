I'm working on the Lua-based firmo project (located at /home/gregg/Projects/lua-library/firmo), specifically on the coverage and reporting modules. Here's where we are:

COMPLETED WORK:
1. Migrated all formatters (HTML, JSON, TAP, CSV, LCOV, JUnit) from lib/coverage/ to lib/reporting/formatters/
2. Removed old format.lua from lib/coverage/
3. Updated the core reporting interface (lib/reporting/init.lua)
4. Created comprehensive test files:
   - tests/reporting/formatter_test.lua (tests individual formatters)
   - tests/reporting/core_test.lua (tests the reporting interface)
5. Updated docs/firmo/plan.md with a detailed "Testing and Validation Phase" section

CURRENT STATUS:
1. We've implemented the code but haven't validated it through testing yet
2. We've updated plan.md (section "Testing and Validation Phase", line ~294-372)
3. Next immediate tasks are to run tests and fix any issues before proceeding

NEXT ACTIONS (from plan.md):
1. Run reporting tests: `lua test.lua tests/reporting/`
2. Document and categorize any failures by module
3. Fix issues one by one, following proper error handling patterns
4. Re-test after each fix to verify resolution
5. Generate reports in all formats and validate their contents
6. Compare coverage data with actual code execution patterns

KEY RULES:
1. Use JSDoc to document all files and functions
2. Follow single responsibility principle
3. Use error_handler for error management
4. Never add special case code for specific files
5. Use central_config system for configuration
6. Never add coverage module into tests (handled by runner.lua)
7. For testing, use expect-style assertions, not assert-style

The actual end goal is to verify working reports from the reporting module with accurate data. Simple code creation is not enough - we must validate through testing that reports correctly represent coverage data.

Please help me continue from this point by running the tests, identifying and fixing issues, and validating the report generation.
