--- Firmo code coverage module
--- This module provides comprehensive code coverage tracking for Lua applications.
--- It implements both line coverage and branch coverage with support for multiple
--- tracking mechanisms including debug hooks and code instrumentation.
---
--- Key features:
--- - Line coverage tracking with execution vs validation distinction
--- - Function and block coverage for more detailed analysis
--- - Multiple tracking modes (debug hook and instrumentation)
--- - Support for source code patchup to improve accuracy
--- - Detailed reporting with coverage statistics
--- - Configurable filtering with include/exclude patterns
--- - Integration with assertion systems for validation coverage
---
--- The coverage module can be used in multiple ways:
--- 1. Automatic tracking through the debug hook (simpler but may miss some code)
--- 2. Instrumentation-based tracking (more thorough but modifies loaded code)
--- 3. Explicit tracking via direct API calls (for integration with testing frameworks)

--- Track line execution without marking as covered.
--- This function records that a specific line has been executed but does not mark it
--- as covered by test assertions. This is important for distinguishing between code
--- that merely ran (execution) versus code that was explicitly validated (coverage).

--- The distinction between execution and coverage is a core feature of the Firmo
--- testing framework:
--- - Execution tracking (this function) shows what code ran during tests
--- - Coverage tracking (mark_line_covered) shows what code was validated by assertions
---

--- to record line execution during program run.

--- Track a line as both executed and covered in a single operation.
--- This function marks a specific line as both executed and covered, which is a

--- of track_execution() and mark_line_covered() into a single call.
---
--- This function is particularly useful in:
--- - Instrumented code where you want to track both execution and coverage
--- - Test assertions that should both track execution and validate code
--- - Custom test runners that need to mark lines in a single operation

--- only marks it as covered, this function does both, making it more efficient

--- Mark a line as covered (validated by assertions).
--- This function explicitly marks a line as covered, meaning it has been validated by test 
--- assertions or other validation mechanisms. This is distinct from merely executing the line.
---
--- The coverage system distinguishes between executed lines (code that ran) and covered lines
--- (code that was validated). This distinction is crucial for measuring test quality:
--- - High execution with low coverage suggests tests don't validate much of what they run
--- - High coverage relative to execution suggests comprehensive validation
---

--- lines where assertions are successful. It can also be called manually to mark lines
--- as validated through other means.

--- Check if a specific line has been executed during the program run.
--- This function verifies if a line in a given file has been executed at least once.
--- Execution tracking records every time a line runs, regardless of whether it was
--- explicitly validated by a test assertion.
---
--- This is distinct from was_line_covered(), which checks if a line was explicitly
--- validated by assertions. The distinction is important for test quality measurement:
--- - Executed lines (tracked by this function) represent code that ran
--- - Covered lines (tracked by was_line_covered) represent code that was validated
---
--- A high-quality test suite should aim to have coverage close to execution numbers,
--- meaning most executed code was also validated.

--- Check if a specific line has been covered by test assertions.

--- testing philosophy:
--- - Execution shows what code ran during tests
--- - Coverage shows what code was explicitly validated
