# Knowledge Documentation Standardization Plan

## Phase 1: Template Development

1. Analyze existing knowledge.md files to identify common patterns
2. Develop standardized template with sections:
   - Purpose
   - Key Concepts
   - Usage Examples
   - Related Components
3. Validate template against project architecture docs
4. Document template format in docs/guides/knowledge_template.md

## Phase 2: Content Audit & Update

1. Create inventory of all 61 knowledge.md files
2. Categorize files into:
   - Complete (matches new standard)
   - Partial (needs updates)
   - Empty (needs creation)
3. For each file:

   - Verify accuracy against current functionality
   - Apply new template structure
   - Ensure consistent formatting

4. VERY IMPORTANT: After each file is updated, mark that file as completed in the list below.

## Phase 3: New Content Creation

1. For empty knowledge.md files:
   - Consult relevant source code and tests
   - Draft content following template
   - Include practical examples
2. Cross-link related knowledge articles
3. Add navigation breadcrumbs where applicable
4. VERY IMPORTANT: After each file is updated, mark that file as completed in the list below.

## Phase 4: Quality Control

1. Validate against source code changes
2. Verify all external links
3. Check for consistent terminology

## Phase 5: Maintenance Plan

1. Document process in CONTRIBUTING.md
2. Document need to update knowledge.md files into docs/firmo/plan.md and docs/firmo/architecture.md
