# Knowledge Documentation Standardization Plan

## Phase 1: knowledge.md Template

1. This is the knowledge document template, read it and use it, docs/guides/knowledge_template.md

## Phase 2: Content Audit & Update

1. Mark all files in the "List of files to review for updates" below as not completed.
2. Ensure every file listed in "List of files to review for updates" actually exist in the firmo project,
   if any files are in this list but don't exist on the filesystem, then remove that file from the list.
3. Ensure the list in "List of files to review for updates" is complete, it should contain every knowledge.md
   file in the examples direcotry. List every knowledge.md file in the firmo project and add any missing ones to
   the "List of files to review for updates".
4. Review every sub-directory in the firmo project, look for knowledge.md files in the sub-directory, if the
   sub-directory doesn't have a knowledge.md file and you think it should have a knowledge.md file then create a
   blank knowledge.md file in that sub-directory and add it to the list in "List of files to review for udpates".
5. For each file:

   - Verify accuracy against current functionality
   - Apply new template structure
   - Ensure consistent formatting

6. VERY IMPORTANT: After each file is updated, mark that file as completed in the list below.

## Phase 3: New Content Creation

1. For empty knowledge.md files:
   - Consult relevant source code and tests
   - Draft content following template
   - Include practical examples
2. Cross-link related knowledge articles
3. Add navigation breadcrumbs where applicable
4. VERY IMPORTANT: After each file is updated, mark that file as completed in the list below.

## Phase 4: Quality Control

1. Validate against source code changes
2. Verify all external links
3. Check for consistent terminology

## Phase 5: Maintenance Plan

1. Document process in CONTRIBUTING.md
2. Document need to update knowledge.md files into docs/firmo/plan.md and docs/firmo/architecture.md
