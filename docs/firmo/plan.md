# Coverage System Integration Plan

## Overview

The coverage system will integrate LuaCov's proven debug hook-based coverage tracking into firmo, enhanced with firmo's robust file operations, error handling, and reporting capabilities. This integration will provide reliable coverage data while maintaining firmo's high standards for code quality and maintainability.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. Debug Hook Coverage
   - Use LuaCov's battle-tested debug hook system
   - Track line execution through debug hooks
   - Support for coroutines and thread safety
   - Clean hook lifecycle management

2. File Operations
   - All file access through firmo's filesystem module
   - Temporary file handling via temp_file module
   - Standardized path operations
   - Error handling through error_handler

3. Configuration Management
   - Settings managed by central_config
   - Clean configuration interface
   - No direct LuaCov config files
   - Configurable behaviors

4. Reporting System
   - Coverage data normalized for firmo's reporting
   - Multiple output format support
   - Clean data visualization
   - Integration with existing formatters

## Implementation Plan

1. Core Integration
   - Create new coverage module
   - Adapt LuaCov's debug hook system
   - Implement clean file operations
   - Set up error handling

2. System Integration
   - Connect to firmo's filesystem module
   - Use temp_file for temporary storage
   - Implement error_handler patterns 
   - Configure through central_config

3. Reporting Integration
   - Map coverage data to firmo format
   - Integrate with reporting system
   - Update formatters for coverage
   - Remove HTML report generator

4. Testing System
   - Create comprehensive tests
   - Validate hook functionality
   - Test error handling
   - Verify report generation

## Development Guidelines

1. File Operations
   - Use filesystem module exclusively
   - Handle paths consistently 
   - Clean up resources properly
   - Follow error patterns

2. Error Handling
   - Use error_handler module
   - Proper error propagation
   - Clean recovery patterns
   - Detailed error context

3. Configuration
   - Use central_config system
   - No hardcoded values
   - Clean configuration access
   - Standardized options

4. Testing
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Test error conditions
   - Validate hook behavior
   - Check reporting accuracy

## Success Criteria

The implementation is complete when:
- Coverage tracking works reliably
- All file operations use firmo modules
- All errors use error_handler
- Configuration uses central_config
- Coverage data flows to reporting
- All tests pass successfully
- Documentation is updated
- No legacy code remains

## Testing Approach

1. Test Coverage Components
   - Debug hook functionality
   - File operations through modules
   - Error handling patterns
   - Configuration management
   - Report generation

2. Integration Testing
   - Complete coverage workflow
   - Error condition handling
   - Configuration changes
   - Report accuracy

## Module Integration

The coverage module will interact with:

1. filesystem module
   - File read/write operations
   - Path manipulation
   - Directory operations

2. temp_file module
   - Temporary storage needs
   - Automatic cleanup
   - Resource management

3. error_handler
   - Standardized errors
   - Error propagation
   - Recovery patterns

4. central_config
   - Coverage settings
   - File patterns
   - Reporter configuration
