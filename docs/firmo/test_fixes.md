## Common Improvements Across All Files



- **Consistent Error Handling**:
  - Using test_helper.with_error_capture() for error handling
  - Using expect_error option in test definitions where appropriate
  - Using detailed error verification patterns
- **Proper Documentation**:
  - Consistent JSDoc-style headers for all files
  - Block-level documentation for test sections
  - Consistent comment style and coverage
- **Test Structure**:
