   - Reference: Phase 4 findings

4. **Robust Testing Infrastructure**  
   - Proper expect-style assertions throughout  
   - Effective debug hook coverage implementation  
   - Reference: Phase 5 findings

## Top Recommended Improvements

1. **Split Large Modules** (High Priority)  
   - Break up files >500 lines (e.g. coverage/init.lua)  
   - Reference: Phase 2 finding line 67-70

2. **Expand Edge Case Testing** (High Priority)  
   - Add more error/boundary condition tests  
   - Focus on async and performance-critical paths  
   - Reference: Phase 5 finding line 201-203

3. **Standardize Knowledge Files** (Medium Priority)  
   - Create template for consistent knowledge.md structure  
   - Add more usage examples where needed  
   - Reference: Phase 4 finding line 142-144

4. **Improve Complex Section Documentation** (Medium Priority)  
   - Add more inline comments to debug hook and other complex logic  
   - Better document lazy-loaded dependencies  
   - Reference: Phase 2 finding line 70-71

5. **Create Test Helpers** (Low Priority)  
   - Develop shared helpers for common test patterns  
   - Reference: Phase 5 finding line 180-181

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Prioritization:**
   - Complete critical items within 2 weeks
   - Medium items within 1 month
   - Low items as bandwidth allows

2. **Tracking:**
   - Create GitHub issues for each recommendation
   - Link to specific findings in detailed review

3. **Validation:**
   - Schedule follow-up review after key improvements
   - Verify fixes against original findings
