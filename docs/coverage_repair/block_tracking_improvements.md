# Block Tracking Improvements

## Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the improvements made to the block coverage tracking system in Firmo.

### Path Normalization Enhancements

Path normalization was enhanced across all block tracking functions to ensure consistent handling of file paths:

1. **Enhanced fs.normalize_path**
   - Improved handling of path components like "." and ".."
   - Better preservation of root slashes and trailing slashes
   - More robust path reconstruction
   - Implementation of missing get_current_directory function

2. **Robust Error Handling**
   - All block tracking functions now use error_handler.safe_io_operation for path normalization
   - Proper error propagation with structured error objects
   - Fallback to original paths when normalization fails
   - Detailed error logging with contextual information

3. **Debug Logging**
   - Added debug logs for path normalization to help with troubleshooting
   - Logs include both original and normalized paths
   - Timestamp information to track sequence issues
   - Runtime context like block IDs, line numbers, and types

### Line Execution Tracking Improvements

The line execution tracking system was significantly enhanced to address reliability issues:

1. **Enhanced `was_line_executed` Function**
   - Improved path normalization consistency
   - Multiple fallback mechanisms for checking execution:
     - First checks execution counts directly
     - Then checks executed lines array
     - Falls back to covered lines table
     - Finally checks global execution data
   - Added debug logging for path normalization issues

2. **Direct Data Structure Updates**
   - Added direct data structure updates in the debug hook
   - Redundant line marking as a fallback mechanism
   - More reliable execution count tracking

3. **Improved Test Structure**
   - Pre-initialization of file tracking before executing code
   - Explicit path normalization in tests
   - Manual tracking of executed lines as a backup mechanism

### Block Relationship Tracking Improvements

The parent-child relationship tracking for blocks was significantly enhanced:

1. **Enhanced add_block Function**
   - Robust handling of parent-child relationships
   - Verification that blocks aren't added as children multiple times
   - Detailed debug logging for relationship tracking

2. **Deferred Relationship Processing**
   - Added support for blocks that reference parents that don't yet exist
   - Deferred relationship tracking with _pending_child_blocks
   - Automatic resolution when parent blocks are later added
   - Clean-up of pending relationships after resolution

3. **Unified Global Tracking**
   - Consistent tracking in coverage_data.blocks tables
   - Clear distinction between executed and covered blocks
   - Better tracking of parent block execution when children are executed

## Functions Updated

The following functions were updated with these improvements:

1. **debug_hook.lua:**
   - `track_block` - Enhanced with better path normalization 
   - `track_blocks_for_line` - Improved error handling
   - `track_block_execution` - Better relationship tracking
   - `track_conditions_for_line` - Enhanced error handling
   - `add_block` - Improved parent-child relationship tracking
   - `was_line_executed` - Complete rewrite with robust fallbacks
   - `fix_block_relationships` - New function to repair relationship inconsistencies
   - `debug_hook` - Enhanced with direct data structure updating and better error handling

2. **coverage/init.lua:**
   - `stop` - Added call to fix_block_relationships for auto-fixing
   - `set_auto_fix_block_relationships` - New function to control auto-fixing
   - `reset` - Fixed to properly preserve file structure

3. **filesystem.lua:**
   - `get_current_directory` - Added missing implementation

## Testing

Two example files were created to test these improvements:

1. **simple_block_coverage.lua**
   - Tests general block coverage tracking
   - Includes nested if/else blocks
   - Includes loop with nested condition

2. **block_coverage_example.lua**
   - Tests path normalization with different path formats
   - Tests nested function definitions
   - Tests direct track_block calls with different path formats
   - Verifies parent-child relationship tracking

## Expected Benefits

These improvements should resolve several issues with block coverage tracking and line execution tracking:

1. **Path Consistency**
   - Blocks will be tracked consistently regardless of path format
   - Different references to the same file will be normalized correctly
   - Execution tracking will work regardless of path format used

2. **Nested Block Tracking**
   - Parent-child relationships will be maintained correctly
   - Deeply nested structures will be properly tracked
   - Blocks that reference not-yet-defined parents will work
   - Auto-fixing of relationships at the end of coverage session

3. **Error Resilience**
   - Path normalization failures won't crash the coverage system
   - Appropriate fallbacks when normalization fails
   - Better error diagnostics through logging
   - Multiple fallback mechanisms for line execution tracking

4. **Execution Tracking Reliability**
   - More reliable tracking of executed lines
   - Correct execution count tracking
   - Proper file initialization before tracking
   - Consistent coverage data across different approaches

## Static Analyzer Improvements

We've made significant enhancements to the static analyzer to better detect block boundaries and handle nested structures:

1. **Enhanced If-Block Processing**
   - Improved handling of elseif chains with proper nesting
   - Added explicit condition blocks for better coverage tracking
   - More precise boundary detection for then/else blocks
   - Better handling of nested conditions

2. **Enhanced Parent-Child Relationship Processing**
   - Added multi-pass approach to establish relationships
   - Implemented deferred relationship processing for blocks created out of order
   - Added fallback mechanism to connect orphaned blocks to root
   - Improved consistency validation with better logging

3. **Improved get_blocks_for_line Function**
   - Added efficient block mapping with parent traversal
   - Better handling of overlapping blocks
   - Predictable sorting based on nesting depth
   - Enhanced logging for tracking complex nested relationships

These improvements ensure that complex nested structures like if-elseif-else chains and nested loops are properly tracked, with accurate parent-child relationships regardless of the order in which blocks are created during analysis.

## HTML Visualization Enhancements

We've implemented a complete suite of HTML visualization enhancements for block coverage:

1. **CSS Styling for Block Visualization**
   - Added nested block depth indicators with varying colors
   - Implemented parent-child relationship visual styling
   - Enhanced block border and background styling
   - Added hover effects for block highlighting

2. **Interactive Block Relationship Visualization**
   - Added hover highlighting for related blocks
   - Implemented visual distinction between parent and child blocks
   - Enhanced tooltips with block relationship information
   - Added relationship indicator for nested block structures

3. **Configuration Options**
   - Added enable_block_relationship_highlighting configuration flag
   - Seamless integration with existing code folding and navigation features
   - Configurable through central config system

4. **Enhanced UI Experience**
   - Block depth-based coloring and indentation
   - Automatic highlighting of related blocks on hover
   - Differentiation between start, end, and inner block lines
   - Advanced tooltips with execution and relationship information

   - Clarify distinction between execution and coverage
   - Fix inconsistency where non-validated lines are incorrectly marked as covered
   - Add better configuration control for coverage behavior
   - Fix debug hook reliability for dofile() and other code execution methods
