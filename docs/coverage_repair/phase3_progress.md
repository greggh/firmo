### 2025-03-11: Formatter Integration Plan

We have analyzed the formatters system architecture and created a comprehensive integration plan for Phase 3 of the centralized configuration system. The key components identified include:

1. **Formatter Registry** (`lib/reporting/formatters/init.lua`):
   - Manages registration of all formatter modules
   - Provides dynamic loading of built-in and custom formatters
   - Maintains lists of formatters by type (coverage, quality, results)

2. **Individual Formatters** (`lib/reporting/formatters/*.lua`):
   - Currently includes: html, summary, json, lcov, cobertura, junit, tap, and csv
   - Each formatter implements specialized formatting functions

3. **Integration Approach**:
   - Schema registration for each formatter type with appropriate defaults
   - Lazy loading pattern to avoid circular dependencies
   - Consistent configuration access pattern across formatters
   - Backward compatibility layers for existing code

4. **Configuration Needs by Formatter**:

| Formatter | Purpose | Configuration Needs |
|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| html      | Rich HTML reports for coverage/quality | Theme, detail level, asset paths |
| summary   | Text summaries | Verbosity level, output format |
| json      | Machine-readable JSON | Pretty printing, schema version |
| lcov      | Standard coverage format | Path normalization settings |
| cobertura | XML coverage for CI systems | XML attributes, schema version |
| junit     | XML test result format | XML attributes, schema version |
| tap       | Test Anything Protocol | TAP version, verbosity |
| csv       | Spreadsheet-compatible | Delimiter, quote character |

The integration will follow a systematic approach, focusing first on core formatters (HTML, JSON, Summary) followed by the specialized formatters. For each formatter, we'll implement:

1. Configuration loading with appropriate defaults
2. Integration with the central_config system
3. Backward compatibility support
4. Debug logging for configuration values
5. Comprehensive documentation

This approach will ensure consistent configuration management across all formatters while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code.
