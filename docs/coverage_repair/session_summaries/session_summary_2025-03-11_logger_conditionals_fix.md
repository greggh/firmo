# Session Summary: Fix Logger Conditionals in firmo.lua (2025-03-11)

## Overview

This session focused on addressing the critical issue identified in the previous session: fixing the logger conditionals in firmo.lua to treat the logger as a required dependency, just like error_handler. This change is part of the project-wide error handling plan and ensures consistency in how core dependencies are handled throughout the framework.

## Key Changes

1. **Logger Initialization**:
   - Updated logger initialization to treat it as a required dependency
   - Added error throwing if logging module could not be loaded
   - Removed conditional fallbacks for logger availability

2. **Logging Configuration**:
   - Updated logging configuration section to remove conditional checks
   - Ensured all logging calls are direct without conditionals
   - Added proper error handling for configuration failures

3. **Discovery Functions**:
   - Updated discover function to use logger directly without checks
   - Enhanced run_discovered function with direct logging calls
   - Removed conditional fallbacks for logger availability

4. **Test Execution**:
   - Updated run_file function to use logger directly
   - Removed conditional logging in test result reporting
   - Enhanced error reporting with consistent logging

5. **CLI and Interactive Mode**:
   - Updated cli_run function to use logger directly
   - Enhanced watch mode with consistent logging
   - Removed conditional checks in interactive mode

6. **Formatting Functions**:
   - Updated nocolor function with direct logger usage
   - Enhanced format function with consistent logging patterns
   - Removed conditional checks in color configuration

## Implementation Details

### Logger Initialization

The logger initialization was updated to treat it as a required dependency, similar to error_handler and filesystem:

```lua
-- Load logging module (required for proper error reporting)
local logging = try_require("lib.tools.logging")
if not logging then
  error_handler.throw(
    "Required module 'lib.tools.logging' could not be loaded", 
    error_handler.CATEGORY.CONFIGURATION, 
    error_handler.SEVERITY.FATAL,
    {module = "firmo"}
  )
end
local logger = logging.get_logger("firmo-core")
```

### Logging Configuration

The logging configuration was updated to remove conditional checks:

```lua
-- Configure logging (now a required component)
local success, err = error_handler.try(function()
  logging.configure_from_config("firmo-core")
end)

if not success then
  local context = {
    module = "firmo-core",
    operation = "configure_logging"
  }
  
  -- Log warning but continue - configuration might fail but logging still works
  logger.warn("Failed to configure logging", {
    error = error_handler.format_error(err),
    context = context
  })
end

logger.debug("Logging system initialized", {
  module = "firmo-core",
  modules_loaded = {
    error_handler = true, -- Always true as this is now required
    filesystem = fs ~= nil, -- Always true as this is now required
    logging = true, -- Always true as this is now required
    -- Other modules...
  }
})
```

### Core Functions

All logging calls in core functions were updated to use logger directly without conditional checks:

```lua
-- Before:
if logger then
  logger.error("Parameter validation failed", {
    error = error_handler.format_error(err),
    operation = "discover"
  })
end

-- After:
logger.error("Parameter validation failed", {
  error = error_handler.format_error(err),
  operation = "discover"
})
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: The logger is now treated consistently with other required dependencies.
2. **Code Clarity**: Removing conditional checks simplifies the code and makes it more readable.
3. **Error Handling**: All errors are properly logged without conditional checks.
4. **Reliability**: The framework now fails early if the logging module is not available.
5. **Maintainability**: The code is more maintainable with consistent error handling patterns.

## Remaining Work

While we've updated several sections of the file, the following work remains:

1. **Complete All Sections**: There are still more `if logger` and `if logger and logger.debug` conditionals in other parts of the file that need to be updated.
2. **Test Update**: Run tests to ensure the changes don't break existing functionality.
3. **Documentation Update**: Update the project-wide error handling plan with the completed task.
4. **Extract Assertion Functions**: Begin work on extracting assertion functions to a dedicated module.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Remaining Logger Conditionals**: Continue updating the remaining `if logger` and `if logger and logger.debug` conditionals in firmo.lua.
2. **Test Updates**: Run tests to verify the changes work correctly.
3. **Implement Error Handling in Reporting Modules**: Begin implementing error handling in reporting/init.lua and formatters.
4. **Begin Assertion Module Extraction**: Start work on extracting assertion functions to lib/core/assertions.lua.

This implementation completes a critical task in the project-wide error handling plan, ensuring consistency in how core dependencies are handled throughout the framework.
