# Session Summary: Error Logging Fix

**Date:** March 18, 2025  
**Topic:** Fixing ERROR logs appearing for expected errors in tests  
**Status:** Completed  

## Problem Description

When using the `{ expect_error = true }` flag in test cases to mark tests that deliberately test error conditions, ERROR logs were still appearing in the test output. This was confusing as these are not actual test failures but expected behavior being tested.

The root cause was that the error_handler module was not properly handling logs for expected errors - it was only downgrading them from ERROR to DEBUG level, but if debug logging was enabled, these logs would still appear.

## Implemented Solution

1. Modified the `log_error` function in `lib/tools/error_handler.lua` to intelligently handle logging for tests with the `expect_error` flag.

2. Added a new variable `completely_skip_logging` to track when we're in a test with expected errors.

3. Implemented a balanced approach that:
   - Downgrades ERROR and WARNING logs to DEBUG level
   - Only outputs logs if debug logging is explicitly enabled
   - Preserves all debug/trace logs for when debugging is needed

4. Added documentation comments to clarify the difference between:
   - Tests with `{ expect_error = true }` flag: ERROR/WARNING logs are suppressed or downgraded to DEBUG
   - Tests without the flag: Only VALIDATION and TEST_EXPECTED category errors are suppressed by default

5. Created a test file `tests/error_handling/error_logging_test.lua` to verify the fix works correctly.

## Implementation Details

The key change was improving the logging logic for expected errors in tests. Instead of completely suppressing all logs, we implemented a more nuanced approach:

```lua
-- When in a test with expect_error flag, handle errors specially
if completely_skip_logging then
  -- Store the error in a global table for potential debugging if needed
  _G._firmo_test_errors = _G._firmo_test_errors or {}
  table.insert(_G._firmo_test_errors, err)
  
  -- Don't skip all logging - only downgrade ERROR and WARNING logs to DEBUG
  -- This allows explicit debug logging to still work
  if err.severity == M.SEVERITY.ERROR or err.severity == M.SEVERITY.WARNING then
    log_level = "debug"
  end
  
  -- Additionally check if debug logs are explicitly enabled
  local debug_enabled = logger.is_debug_enabled and logger.is_debug_enabled()
  if not debug_enabled then
    -- If debug logs aren't enabled, skip logging entirely
    return
  end
  -- Otherwise, continue with debug-level logging
end
```

This approach:
1. Still prevents ERROR logs from cluttering test output
2. Preserves debug information when explicitly requested via debug logging level
3. Provides a better balance between clean test output and debuggability

## Testing

Created a dedicated test file `tests/error_handling/error_logging_test.lua` that:

1. Tests both cases (with and without the `expect_error` flag)
2. Verifies that errors are still captured and available to the test
3. Confirms errors are stored in the global error table
4. Covers different error generation methods

The test output now clearly shows only the expected errors (from test cases without the `expect_error` flag), while appropriately suppressing error logs from test cases that specifically test error conditions.

## Benefits

1. Clearer test output without misleading ERROR logs for expected test conditions
2. More accurate representation of test results
3. Easier to identify actual failures
4. Improved development experience when running tests that validate error conditions

## Next Steps

1. Update remaining coverage module tests (instrumentation, static_analyzer) to use this standardized error testing pattern:
   ```lua
   it("test case description", { expect_error = true }, function()
     local result, err = test_helper.with_error_capture(function()
       return function_that_should_error()
     end)()
     
     expect(result).to_not.exist()
     expect(err).to.exist()
     expect(err.category).to.exist() -- Avoid overly specific category checks for flexibility
   end)
   ```

2. Apply the same pattern to reporting tests

3. Document best practices for error testing in CLAUDE.md

4. Resolve test summary inconsistencies (files_failed vs tests_failed) in runner.lua

## Verification Results

The fix was verified by:

1. Creating a dedicated test file (`tests/error_handling/error_logging_test.lua`) with tests for both cases:
   - Tests without the expect_error flag: ERROR logs appear as expected
   - Tests with the expect_error flag: No ERROR logs appear

2. Running core module tests to confirm there are no unexpected ERROR logs

This fix completes an important part of the error testing standardization work by ensuring that error logs don't clutter the test output when testing expected error conditions.
