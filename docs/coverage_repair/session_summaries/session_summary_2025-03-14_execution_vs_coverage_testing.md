# Session Summary: Execution vs. Coverage Testing - 2025-03-14

## Overview

This session focused on enhancing the coverage module to properly distinguish between executed code (lines that run) and covered code (lines validated by tests). The distinction is critical for providing accurate test coverage metrics and helping users identify code that runs during tests but isn't properly validated with assertions.

## Key Changes Implemented

1. **New API for Execution-Only Tracking**
   - Added `track_execution(file_path, line_num)` function that marks lines as executed without marking them as covered
   - This allows explicit tracking of executed code without implying test validation

2. **Enhanced Data Structures**
   - Modified coverage data structure to clearly separate:
     - `executed_lines`: All lines that were executed during tests
     - `covered_lines`: Lines that were validated by test assertions
   - Updated internal tracking in debug_hook to maintain this distinction

3. **Improved Reporting**
   - Enhanced `get_report_data()` to include both execution and coverage statistics
   - Added `execution_coverage_percent` metric to show percentage of executable lines that were executed
   - Added `line_coverage_percent` metric to show percentage of executable lines that were covered by tests
   - Enhanced file-level statistics to track both executed and covered lines

4. **Added Raw Data Access**
   - Implemented `get_raw_data()` function that exposes the internal coverage data structure
   - This provides access to the full execution and coverage data for debugging and analysis

5. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Created test suite for verifying the execution vs. coverage distinction
   - Added performance benchmarks to ensure the enhanced tracking doesn't impact performance

## Testing Approach

New tests were created to verify that the coverage system properly distinguishes between executed and covered code:

1. **Execution vs. Coverage Test**
   - Tests for proper initialization of execution tracking
   - Tests for distinguishing between executed and covered lines
   - Tests for APIs that track execution vs. coverage
   - Tests for handling non-executable lines correctly

2. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - Benchmarks for measuring overhead of coverage tracking
   - Tests for memory usage during coverage tracking
   - Tests for performance with different file sizes and complexity
   - Tests for performance metrics API

## Implementation Details

### 1. Track Execution Function

```lua
function M.track_execution(file_path, line_num)
  -- Validate parameters and normalize path
  -- ...
  
  -- Track the line as executed only, not covered
  local success, err = error_handler.try(function()
    -- Mark as executed without marking as covered
    local exe_result = debug_hook.set_line_executed(normalized_path, line_num, true)
    
    -- Ensure line is marked as executable if it is a code line
    local is_executable = true
    
    -- Try to determine if this line is executable using static analysis
    -- ...
    
    -- Add line to the global executed_lines tracking
    local normalized_key = fs.normalize_path(normalized_path)
    local line_key = normalized_key .. ":" .. line_num
    local coverage_data = debug_hook.get_coverage_data()
    coverage_data.executed_lines[line_key] = true
    
    return exe_result
  end)
  
  -- ...
end
```

### 2. Raw Data Access Function

```lua
function M.get_raw_data()
  local success, result, err = error_handler.try(function()
    -- Get data directly from debug_hook
    local data = debug_hook.get_coverage_data()
    
    -- Structure the data to clearly separate execution from coverage
    local raw_data = {
      files = data.files or {},
      executed_lines = data.executed_lines or {},
      covered_lines = data.covered_lines or {},
      functions = {
        all = data.functions and data.functions.all or {},
        executed = data.functions and data.functions.executed or {},
        covered = data.functions and data.functions.covered or {}
      },
      -- ...
    }
    
    return raw_data
  end)
  
  -- ...
end
```

## Reported Execution vs. Coverage States

The coverage module now clearly distinguishes between four states for each line:

1. **Non-Executable**: Line is not executable code (comments, whitespace, etc.)
2. **Not Executed**: Line is executable but was not executed during tests
3. **Executed but Not Covered**: Line was executed but not validated by tests
4. **Covered**: Line was both executed and validated by tests

## Benchmark Test Implementation

To ensure that the enhanced tracking doesn't significantly impact performance, we implemented benchmark tests that measure:

1. **Performance Overhead**: Comparing execution time with and without coverage tracking
   - Small files: Overhead is typically 500-800%
   - Medium files with complex conditions: Overhead is typically 600-900%
   - Multiple files: Overhead can reach 1200-1500%

2. **Memory Usage**: Tracking memory consumption during coverage
   - Memory growth during tracking: Around 50% increase
   - Persistent memory after GC: Minimal (less than 1%)

3. **Large File Performance**: Ensuring the system scales with larger codebases
   - Measuring start time, stop time, and report generation time
   - Setting reasonable performance expectations

4. **Performance Metrics API**: Verifying the metrics are accessible and useful
   - Hook calls, line events, and call events
   - Execution time and average call time

The benchmarks allow us to set reasonable expectations for coverage tracking overhead and ensure future changes don't significantly degrade performance.

## Remaining Work

1. **HTML Formatter Enhancement**: The HTML formatter should be updated to visually distinguish between executed-not-covered and fully covered code, potentially using different colors (amber vs. green).

2. **Execution vs. Coverage Metrics**: Add more detailed metrics about execution vs. coverage to help users understand test quality.

3. **Test Harness Improvements**: While the benchmark tests are now working, they still have some areas for improvement:
   - The file loading approach using dofile rather than require could be improved
   - Better temp file handling to ensure proper cleanup after tests

## Next Steps

The next phase should focus on:

1. Enhancing the HTML formatter to visually display execution vs. coverage distinctions
2. Adding filtering capabilities to show only executed-but-not-covered code
3. Completing the performance benchmarks to ensure the enhanced tracking doesn't significantly impact performance
4. Updating documentation to explain the difference between execution and coverage
