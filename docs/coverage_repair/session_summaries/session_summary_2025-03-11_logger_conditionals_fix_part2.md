# Session Summary: Fix Logger Conditionals in firmo.lua (Part 2) (2025-03-11)

## Overview

This session continued the critical task of fixing logger conditionals in firmo.lua, treating the logger as a required dependency similar to error_handler and filesystem. We made significant progress in removing conditional checks, but due to the size of the file and number of instances, additional work remains to complete this task.

## Progress Made

1. **Logger Initialization and Configuration**:
   - ✅ Updated logger initialization to treat it as a required dependency
   - ✅ Modified the logging configuration to assume logger is always available
   - ✅ Added error throwing if logging module could not be loaded

2. **Core Functions**:
   - ✅ Fixed discover function to use logger directly
   - ✅ Updated run_file and run_discovered functions
   - ✅ Enhanced watch mode with consistent logging
   - ✅ Improved error reporting with consistent logging patterns

3. **Format and Describe Functions**:
   - ✅ Updated format function to remove conditional checks
   - ✅ Enhanced describe function with direct logger usage
   - ✅ Fixed fdescribe and xdescribe functions (partial)
   - ✅ Removed conditional checks for trace and debug level logging

## Remaining Work

Several sections of firmo.lua still contain conditional logger checks that need to be updated:

1. **Test Functions**:
   - [ ] Fix it function and its variants (fit, xit)
   - [ ] Update before/after hooks
   - [ ] Fix assertions and tags functions
   - [ ] Update should_run_test with direct logger usage

2. **Reporting Functions**:
   - [ ] Fix conditional logging in test result reporting
   - [ ] Update error reporting in test execution
   - [ ] Fix debug and trace logging throughout 

3. **CLI Functions**:
   - [ ] Further update cli_run function
   - [ ] Fix interactive mode logging
   - [ ] Update configuration and option handling

## Implementation Pattern

Throughout the implementation, we consistently applied the same pattern:

1. **Remove Conditional Checks**:
   ```lua
   -- Before:
   if logger then
     logger.error("Error message", {
       context = data
     })
   end
   
   -- After:
   logger.error("Error message", {
     context = data
   })
   ```

2. **Trace and Debug Logging**:
   ```lua
   -- Before:
   if logger and logger.debug then
     logger.debug("Debug message", {
       context = data
     })
   end
   
   -- After:
   logger.debug("Debug message", {
     context = data
   })
   ```

## Next Steps

To complete this task, we need to:

1. Continue systematically removing the remaining `if logger` and `if logger and logger.debug` conditionals throughout firmo.lua
2. Run tests to verify the changes work correctly
3. Update the project-wide error handling plan with the completed task
4. Begin implementing error handling in reporting modules
5. Begin work on extracting assertion functions to a dedicated module

This implementation significantly improves code consistency and simplifies the codebase by treating logger as a required dependency alongside error_handler and filesystem. The remaining work should follow the same pattern for consistency.
