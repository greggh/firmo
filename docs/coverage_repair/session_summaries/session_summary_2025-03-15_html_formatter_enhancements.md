# Session Summary: HTML Formatter Enhancements

Date: 2025-03-15

## Overview

This session focused on enhancing the HTML formatter to better visualize the execution vs. coverage distinction implemented in Phase 2. We improved tooltip information, updated visual styling, added interactive filtering, and fixed issues with source code display in HTML reports. The enhancements provide users with more detailed information about execution counts and visually distinguish between code that merely executes and code that is properly covered by tests.

## Key Changes

1. **Enhanced Tooltips**
   - Added detailed tooltips showing execution counts for each line
   - Created distinct tooltip styles for the four different line states
   - Added block execution count information in tooltips
   - Included condition evaluation details showing branch coverage

2. **Improved Visual Distinction**
   - Updated CSS to clearly distinguish between covered, executed-not-covered, uncovered, and non-executable lines
   - Added color coding for better visual cues (green, yellow, red, gray)
   - Implemented hover effects to highlight important information
   - Enhanced block and condition visualization

3. **Interactive Filtering**
   - Added filter controls to focus on specific coverage states
   - Implemented buttons to switch between different views
   - Added JavaScript for dynamic filtering functionality

4. **Fixed Source Code Display**
   - Resolved issues with source code not appearing in HTML reports
   - Fixed file path handling for consistent file tracking
   - Improved how the HTML formatter accesses and processes source code

## Implementation Details

### HTML Formatter Enhancements

1. **Tooltip System**
   ```lua
   local function format_source_line(line_num, content, is_covered, is_executable, blocks, conditions, is_executed, execution_count)
     -- Enhanced tooltips with specific messages for each state
     if is_executable == false then
       -- Non-executable line tooltip
       tooltip = ' title="Non-executable line: Comment, blank line, or syntax element"'
     elseif is_covered and is_executable then
       -- Covered line tooltip with execution count
       tooltip = string.format(' data-execution-count="%d" title="✓ Covered: Executed %d times and validated by tests"', 
                            exec_count, exec_count)
     elseif is_executed and is_executable then
       -- Executed-not-covered tooltip with guidance
       tooltip = string.format(' data-execution-count="%d" title="⚠ Execution without validation: Line executed %d times but not properly validated by tests. Add assertions to validate this code."', 
                         exec_count, exec_count)
     else
       -- Uncovered tooltip
       tooltip = ' title="❌ Not executed: Line was never reached during test execution"'
     end
   end
   ```

2. **Visual Styling**
   ```css
   /* Line coverage state styling */
   .line.covered { 
     background-color: var(--covered-bg); 
     border-left: 3px solid var(--covered-border);
     color: var(--text-color);
   }
   
   /* Apply highlight effect on hover for covered lines */
   .line.covered:hover {
     background-color: var(--covered-highlight);
     color: #ffffff;
     font-weight: 500;
   }
   
   /* Executed but not covered styling */
   .line.executed-not-covered {
     background-color: var(--executed-not-covered-bg);
     border-left: 3px solid var(--executed-not-covered-border);
     color: var(--text-color);
   }
   
   /* Apply highlight effect on hover for executed-not-covered lines */
   .line.executed-not-covered:hover {
     background-color: var(--executed-not-covered-highlight);
     color: #000000;
     font-weight: 500;
   }
   ```

3. **Filtering System**
   ```html
   <!-- Filter controls for coverage visualization -->
   <div class="filter-controls">
     <h3>Filter View</h3>
     <div class="filter-buttons">
       <button class="filter-btn" data-filter="all" onclick="filterCoverage('all')">All Coverage States</button>
       <button class="filter-btn" data-filter="executed-not-covered" onclick="filterCoverage('executed-not-covered')">Show Executed-Not-Covered Only</button>
       <button class="filter-btn" data-filter="uncovered" onclick="filterCoverage('uncovered')">Show Uncovered Only</button>
       <button class="filter-btn" data-filter="covered" onclick="filterCoverage('covered')">Show Covered Only</button>
     </div>
   </div>
   ```

4. **JavaScript for Interactive Features**
   ```javascript
   // Filter coverage display to show specific coverage states
   function filterCoverage(filterType) {
     // Update active button state
     const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('.filter-btn');
     buttons.forEach(btn => {
       if (btn.dataset.filter === filterType) {
         btn.classList.add('active');
       } else {
         btn.classList.remove('active');
       }
     });
     
     // Apply filtering to all lines
     const lines = document.querySelectorAll('.line');
     
     if (filterType === 'all') {
       // Show all lines
       lines.forEach(line => {
         line.style.display = '';
       });
     } else {
       // Filter to show only lines matching the selected coverage state
       lines.forEach(line => {
         if (line.classList.contains(filterType)) {
           line.style.display = '';
         } else {
           // Special case: always show non-executable lines for context
           if (line.classList.contains('non-executable')) {
             line.style.display = '';
           } else {
             line.style.display = 'none';
           }
         }
       });
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Source Code Display Fix**
   ```lua
   -- Add source code container (if source is available)
   -- First try to get from original_files (backward compatibility)
   local original_file_data = coverage_data and 
                             coverage_data.original_files and
                             coverage_data.original_files[filename]
   
   -- If not found, use the file_data directly (new approach)
   if not original_file_data or not original_file_data.source then
     original_file_data = file_stats
   end
   
   if original_file_data and original_file_data.source then
     -- Process source code...
   end
   ```

## Testing

1. **Test Examples Created**
   - `html_coverage_debug.lua`: Debugging version to diagnose HTML formatter issues
   - `execution_vs_coverage_solution.lua`: Clean example showing the distinction between execution and coverage
   - Both examples demonstrate the four possible line states (covered, executed-not-covered, uncovered, non-executable)

2. **HTML Report Generation**
   - Generated HTML reports with the new formatter
   - Verified that source code is properly displayed
   - Confirmed that tooltips show the correct information
   - Tested the filter functionality to ensure it works as expected

3. **Debug Logging**
   - Added detailed debug logging to diagnose issues with the HTML formatter
   - Created functions to inspect and dump coverage data structures
   - Added verification for source code availability

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Source Code Display Issue**
   - **Challenge**: HTML reports showed file information but no source code
   - **Solution**: Fixed how the HTML formatter accesses source code by supporting multiple data structures and adding a fallback mechanism.

2. **File Path Normalization**
   - **Challenge**: Inconsistent file path handling led to issues with tracking the correct files
   - **Solution**: Improved path normalization and added better error handling for file paths.

3. **Coverage Data Structure**
   - **Challenge**: The HTML formatter expected a specific data structure that wasn't consistently provided
   - **Solution**: Added support for multiple data structure formats and improved robustness when handling missing data.

4. **Data Accuracy Issues**
   - **Challenge**: Discovered that the underlying coverage data itself has accuracy issues (e.g., marking functions as covered when they shouldn't be)
   - **Solution**: Identified the need to fix the core coverage tracking functions in the debug hook module in a future session.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Coverage Data Tracking**
   - Address the issues with accuracy in coverage data tracking
   - Fix the `track_line` and related functions to properly distinguish between execution and coverage
   - Improve how debug_hook processes execution vs. coverage information

2. **Complete HTML Formatter Enhancements**
   - Add a sidebar heat map for quickly identifying hot spots in code
   - Implement a sticky header with file information
   - Create a mini-map visualization for large files
   - Add jump-to-function and jump-to-block functionality

3. **Create Comprehensive Tests**
   - Develop tests specifically for the execution vs. coverage distinction
   - Add verification steps to ensure coverage data is accurate
   - Create automated tests for the HTML formatter

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update documentation to explain the execution vs. coverage distinction
   - Create examples showing how to use the filtering capabilities
   - Add instructions on interpreting the HTML reports
