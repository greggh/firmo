# Session Summary: Test System Reorganization (2025-03-12)

## Overview

In this session, we implemented Phase 1 of the test system reorganization plan, which focused on enhancing the generic runner and creating a central CLI. This work is part of our larger effort to standardize the testing approach across the entire project, which will reduce duplication, improve maintainability, and provide a consistent user experience.

## Work Completed

1. **Enhanced `scripts/runner.lua` as a Universal Tool:**
   - Added support for running a single test file
   - Added support for running all tests in a directory (recursively)
   - Added support for running tests matching a pattern
   - Added standardized command-line arguments
   - Implemented a `find_test_files` function to handle directory scanning
   - Enhanced `run_all` to properly handle both file paths and directory paths
   - Integrated module_reset, coverage, and quality modules with proper error handling
   - Added comprehensive help and usage information
   - Added robust error handling throughout

2. **Created Central CLI in Project Root:**
   - Created `test.lua` redirector that forwards to `scripts/runner.lua`
   - Implemented proper argument forwarding
   - Added error handling to ensure consistent exit codes

3. **Updated Documentation:**
   - Updated `phase4_progress.md` to reflect our progress
   - Created this session summary file

## Key Implementation Details

### Enhanced `scripts/runner.lua`

The primary enhancements to `scripts/runner.lua` included:

1. **Command-line argument parsing:**
   - Added support for both `--option=value` and `--option value` formats
   - Added short flag options (e.g., `-v` for `--verbose`)
   - Added help and usage information with examples

2. **Directory scanning:**
   - Added a `find_test_files` function that uses filesystem module's `discover_files`
   - Added pattern and filter support to find specific test files
   - Added exclusion pattern support to skip certain files (like fixtures)

3. **Framework integration:**
   - Added proper integration with module_reset for test isolation
   - Added coverage module integration with configuration options
   - Added quality module integration with configuration options
   - Added proper report generation for coverage and quality reports

4. **Improved testing flow:**
   - Enhanced the main function to check if a path is a file or directory
   - Added support for watch mode for continuous testing
   - Added proper error handling and exit codes

### Central CLI in Project Root

We created a simple `test.lua` redirector in the project root that:

1. Forwards all arguments to `scripts/runner.lua`
2. Uses `os.execute` to run the proper command
3. Preserves the exit code for proper CI/CD integration
4. Includes error handling to ensure it's run directly, not required

## Next Steps

The next phases of the test system reorganization plan include:

1. **Move Special Test Logic Into Standard Test Files:**
   - Move instrumentation tests to `tests/coverage/instrumentation_test.lua`
   - Organize tests into logical directories: `tests/coverage/`, `tests/reporting/`, etc.
   - Ensure all test files use the standard describe/it pattern

2. **Move Configuration Into Test Files:**
   - Tests that need coverage should configure it in `before` hooks
   - Tests that need instrumentation should enable it in `before` hooks

3. **Create Comprehensive Test Suite File:**
   - Create `tests/all_tests.lua` that loads all test files

4. **Clean up all Special-Purpose Runners:**
   - Remove `run_all_tests.lua` (replaced by standard runner)
   - Remove `run-instrumentation-tests.lua` (logic moved to test files)
   - Remove `run-single-test.lua` (redundant)

## Conclusion

We have successfully completed Phase 1 of the test system reorganization plan. The enhanced runner and central CLI provide a solid foundation for the remaining phases. By standardizing the way tests are run, we can significantly improve the maintainability of the project and provide a better developer experience.
