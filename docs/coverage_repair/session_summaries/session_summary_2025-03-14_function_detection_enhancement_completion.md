## Implementation Details

### Function Detection System

The function detection system was enhanced with the following key improvements:

1. **Index Node Extraction**
   - Created `extract_full_identifier` function to properly handle complex variable patterns
   - Added support for nested table access (e.g., `a.b.c.function`)
   - Implemented special handling for method syntax with colons

2. **Method Detection**
   - Added a dedicated `detect_method_declarations` function
   - Implemented detection for traditional method syntax (`function Class:method()`)
   - Added support for methods defined using the first parameter as `self`
   - Enhanced Index node traversal to properly mark method nodes

3. **Function Type Classification**
   - Added type identification for different function patterns:
     - `global`: Functions defined at global scope
     - `local`: Functions defined with local keyword
     - `method`: Functions using colon syntax or first param as self
     - `module`: Functions defined as module table fields
     - `<anonymous>`: Functions without identifiable names

4. **Parameter Extraction**
   - Implemented extraction of function parameters from ParList nodes
   - Added support for variadic functions with `...` parameters
   - Stored parameter lists for documentation and analysis

5. **Line Boundary Detection**
   - Enhanced line mapping to correctly identify function start and end lines
   - Used AST position information with line mapping for more accurate boundaries
   - Provided fallback strategies when direct mapping isn't available

6. **Context Enhancement**
   - Added content to function context for better analysis
   - Implemented position-to-line mapping for AST nodes
   - Enhanced function search to include more metadata

### Code Map Integration

The function improvements were integrated with the code map system:

1. **Code Map Enhancement**
   - Added function metadata to the code map
   - Enhanced record format to include type, parameters, and line boundaries
   - Added method-specific information where applicable

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Implemented optimizations for line mapping in large files
   - Added incremental processing with periodic timeout checks
   - Used pre-computed values when available to avoid redundant calculations

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite was created to verify function detection capabilities:

1. **Basic Function Tests**
   - Tests for global functions (`function name()`)
   - Tests for local functions (`local function name()`)
   - Tests for anonymous functions (`local x = function()`)
   - Tests for truly anonymous functions (`(function()...end)()`)

2. **Complex Function Tests**
   - Tests for module functions (`M.name = function()`)
   - Tests for nested functions (functions inside other functions)
   - Tests for functions passed as arguments (`call(function() end)`)
   - Tests for method definitions (`function obj:method()`)
   - Tests for class-style methods (`obj = { method = function(self) }`)

3. **Parameter Detection Tests**
   - Tests for function parameter extraction
   - Tests for variadic functions with `...`

4. **Line Detection Tests**
   - Tests for function start line detection
   - Tests for function end line detection
   - Tests for nested function line boundaries

5. **Error Handling Tests**
   - Tests for syntax error handling
   - Tests for empty input handling
   - Tests for code without functions

## Challenges and Solutions

Several challenges were encountered during implementation:

1. **AST Structure Variability**
   - **Challenge**: The Lua AST structure varies significantly based on function definition pattern
   - **Solution**: Implemented multiple detection approaches with fallbacks to handle different AST patterns

2. **Method Syntax Detection**
   - **Challenge**: Colon syntax for methods required special handling as it's not explicitly represented in the AST
   - **Solution**: Added pre-processing step to mark method nodes and detect colon patterns in strings

3. **Line Mapping Complexity**
   - **Challenge**: Converting character positions to line numbers reliably across different content types
   - **Solution**: Created a robust position-to-line mapping system with content access for reference

4. **Nested Function Detection**
   - **Challenge**: Properly tracking relationships between nested functions
   - **Solution**: Enhanced the function detection algorithm to process all functions regardless of nesting

5. **Test Isolation**
   - **Challenge**: Creating isolated test cases for function detection
   - **Solution**: Implemented a temp_file utility to create and clean up test files

## Next Steps

The completion of the function detection enhancement marks a significant milestone in Phase 2. The next steps are:

1. **Block Boundary Identification**
   - Implement stack-based block tracking system
   - Create accurate start/end positions for all block types
   - Establish parent-child relationships between blocks
   - Handle complex nested structures
   - Add block metadata for reporting

2. **Condition Expression Tracking**
   - Enhance condition expression detection
   - Decompose compound conditions (a and b, a or b)
   - Implement tracking of condition outcomes (true/false)
   - Connect conditions to blocks
   - Add condition complexity analysis

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Create integration tests between function detection and block tracking
   - Verify proper relationships between functions, blocks, and conditions

These enhancements will build on the solid foundation of the improved function detection system to provide a comprehensive static analysis capability.
