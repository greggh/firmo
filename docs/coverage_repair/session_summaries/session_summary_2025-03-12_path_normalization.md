# Session Summary: 2025-03-12 Path Normalization

## Overview

In today's session, we focused on fixing critical path normalization issues in the coverage module's instrumentation approach. The primary issue was inconsistent path handling between different components, leading to files being instrumented correctly but not appearing in coverage reports.

## Key Issues Addressed

1. **Path Normalization Inconsistencies**: Files were being instrumented but not tracked properly due to path inconsistencies.
2. **File Activation System**: Files discovered by the instrumentation process weren't being marked for inclusion in reports.
3. **Path Format Differences**: Path formatting differed between components, causing tracking mismatches.
4. **Environment Variable Handling**: Improper environment variable handling in instrumented code led to execution errors.

## Implementation Details

### Path Normalization

We implemented consistent path normalization across all key functions using this pattern:
```lua
file_path = file_path:gsub("//", "/"):gsub("\\", "/")
```

Key locations where this pattern was added:
- `instrumentation.lua:251`: In `instrument_line` function
- `instrumentation.lua:377`: In `instrument_file` function 
- `init.lua:165`: In `track_line` function
- `init.lua:208`: In `track_function` function
- `init.lua:220`: In `track_block` function

### File Activation System

We implemented a robust file activation system in `debug_hook.lua` to explicitly mark files for inclusion in reports:

```lua
-- Added active_files table to track files that should be included in reporting
local active_files = {}

-- Function to mark a file as active for reporting
function M.activate_file(file_path)
  if not file_path then
    return false
  end
  
  -- Normalize the file path for consistency
  local normalized_path = fs.normalize_path(file_path)
  if not normalized_path then
    normalized_path = file_path:gsub("//", "/"):gsub("\\", "/")
  end
  
  -- Mark file as active
  active_files[normalized_path] = true
  
  -- Ensure file is initialized
  if not coverage_data.files[normalized_path] then
    M.initialize_file(normalized_path)
  end
  
  -- Mark as discovered
  if coverage_data.files[normalized_path] then
    coverage_data.files[normalized_path].discovered = true
    coverage_data.files[normalized_path].active = true
  end
  
  return true
end

-- Accessor function to get the active files list
function M.get_active_files()
  return active_files
end
```

### Environment Variable Preservation

We ensured proper environment variable preservation in instrumented code by adding:
```lua
local _ENV = _G
```
at the beginning of all instrumented code in both static analysis and basic instrumentation code paths.

## Testing and Validation

We used the `run-single-test.lua` script to validate our changes. The script includes four tests:

1. **Basic line instrumentation**: PASSED ✓
2. **Conditional branch instrumentation**: FAILED ✗ (still needs work)
3. **Table constructor instrumentation**: PASSED ✓
4. **Module require instrumentation**: PASSED ✓

Progress is significant with 3 out of 4 tests now passing.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Conditional Branch Test**: The conditional branch test is still failing and needs investigation.
2. **Further Path Normalization**: Continue applying consistent path normalization throughout the codebase.
3. **Enhanced Debugging**: Add more detailed logging to help diagnose remaining issues.
4. **Table Constructor Handling**: Review and improve table constructor handling in instrumentation.
5. **Module Loading**: Enhance module loading through require() with proper path resolution.

## Conclusion

Today's work has significantly improved the instrumentation approach for code coverage tracking. By implementing consistent path normalization and a file activation system, we've fixed several critical issues that were preventing proper tracking of instrumented files. Three of four test cases now pass successfully.
