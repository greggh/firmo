# Session Summary: Fix Logger Conditionals in lust-next.lua (Part 4) (2025-03-11)

## Overview

This session continued our work on fixing logger conditionals in lust-next.lua, treating the logger as a required dependency similar to error_handler and filesystem. We made significant progress removing conditional checks from test execution functions and other remaining areas of the file.

## Progress Made

1. **Fixed it Function**:
   - ✅ Removed all conditional logger checks in parameter validation
   - ✅ Updated error reporting with direct logger usage
   - ✅ Enhanced debug and trace logging to remove conditionals
   - ✅ Fixed error handling for test execution and before/after hooks

2. **Fixed fit Function**:
   - ✅ Removed conditional checks in debug logging
   - ✅ Updated error handling with direct logger usage
   - ✅ Fixed error propagation with consistent logging patterns
   - ✅ Enhanced test execution with standardized patterns

3. **Fixed xit Function**:
   - ✅ Updated parameter validation to use logger directly
   - ✅ Enhanced debug logging with direct logger usage
   - ✅ Fixed error handling for invalid parameters
   - ✅ Ensured consistent error reporting

4. **Fixed should_run_test Function**:
   - ✅ Removed conditional checks in error logging
   - ✅ Updated error handling with direct logger usage
   - ✅ Enhanced error propagation and reporting

5. **Fixed CLI and Watch Mode Functions**:
   - ✅ Updated interactive mode logging
   - ✅ Fixed watch mode logging conditionals
   - ✅ Enhanced error reporting with standardized patterns

## Implementation Details

1. **Standard Pattern Followed**:
   ```lua
   -- Before:
   if logger then
     logger.error("Error message", {
       context = data
     })
   end
   
   -- After:
   logger.error("Error message", {
     context = data
   })
   ```

2. **Debug Logging Pattern**:
   ```lua
   -- Before:
   if logger and logger.debug then
     logger.debug("Debug message", {
       context = data
     })
   end
   
   -- After:
   logger.debug("Debug message", {
     context = data
   })
   ```

3. **Special Case - try_require Function**:
   ```lua
   -- We retained the conditional check in try_require since this function runs
   -- before the logger module is loaded, which would create a circular dependency
   if logger then
     logger.warn("Failed to load module", {
       module = name,
       error = error_handler.format_error(mod)
     })
   end
   ```

## Remaining Work

The primary remaining task is to fix a syntax error that appeared after our changes. This will require:

1. Carefully checking for missing or extra `end` statements
2. Validating the syntax of modified sections
3. Running tests to verify all changes work correctly
4. Update the project-wide error handling plan with the completed task

## Next Steps

To complete this task, we need to:

1. Fix the syntax error in lust-next.lua
2. Run tests to verify the changes work correctly
3. Update the project-wide error handling plan with the completed task
4. Begin implementing error handling in reporting modules

This implementation continues to improve code consistency and simplifies the codebase by treating logger as a required dependency alongside error_handler and filesystem.
