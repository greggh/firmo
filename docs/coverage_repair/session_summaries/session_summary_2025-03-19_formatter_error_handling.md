# Session Summary: Formatter Error Handling

**Date**: March 19, 2025  
**Focus**: Standardizing Error Handling in Formatters and Tests

## Overview

This session continued our work on standardizing error handling patterns across the firmo codebase, with a particular focus on reporting formatters and their tests. We successfully implemented consistent error handling for file operations in the HTML formatter and restored previously skipped tests using the standard error handling patterns.

## Key Issues Addressed

1. **HTML formatter tests skipping critical tests**
   - Many HTML formatter tests were skipped due to implementation changes or filesystem errors
   - The file-saving test was explicitly skipped with the comment "may be issues with filesystem module"

2. **Inconsistent error handling in formatters**
   - Different error handling patterns between `auto_save_reports` and individual formatters
   - `auto_save_reports` returns empty result tables on error, while other functions return nil+error

3. **Path validation inconsistencies**
   - Incomplete path validation in some formatter interfaces
   - Inconsistent handling of special characters and directory existence

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Restored HTML Formatter Tests**
   - Created robust test implementations using proper test directory management
   - Added specific tests for invalid paths using standardized error handling
   - Fixed the filesystem-dependent tests with proper error capture

2. **Standardized Error Testing Patterns**
   - Used `test_helper.with_error_capture()` for testing error conditions
   - Added `expect_error = true` flag to tests that intentionally test errors
   - Implemented proper assertion patterns for different error response types

3. **Created Comprehensive Test File**
   - Developed `format_test.lua` to validate formatter error handling
   - Tested multiple types of error conditions:
     - Invalid file paths with special characters
     - Non-existent directories
     - Permission errors
     - Empty file paths

4. **Identified Interface Differences**
   - Discovered that `auto_save_reports` returns empty result tables on error
   - Individual formatter functions follow the nil+error pattern
   - Added tests for both patterns to ensure consistent behavior

## Learnings

1. **Formatter Architecture Pattern**
   - Formatters themselves don't handle file I/O directly
   - They generate content and return it to reporting.lua
   - The reporting module handles file path validation and writing

2. **Error Handling Strategy Differences**
   - High-level functions like `auto_save_reports` focus on resilience
   - Low-level functions focus on specific error reporting
   - Both approaches are valid depending on the function's role

3. **Testing for Different Error Patterns**
   - Functions that should fail with nil+error need one testing pattern
   - Functions that should return empty results need a different pattern
   - Both patterns can follow the standardized approach using proper validation

4. **Validation Data Requirements**
   - Discovered schema validation requirements for coverage data
   - Tests must provide complete schema-valid data even for error tests

## Specific Changes

1. **In `tests/reporting/formatters/html_formatter_test.lua`**
   - Restored the file-saving test with proper folder management
   - Added specific test for invalid paths with error handling
   - Used the standardized patterns for path validation

2. **Created diagnostic test file `format_test.lua`**
   - Implemented comprehensive tests for formatter file handling
   - Tested both normal operation and error conditions
   - Verified consistent behavior across the reporting interfaces

3. **Fixed test data validation**
   - Added missing required fields to mock coverage data
   - Ensured all tests follow schema requirements

## Remaining Work

1. **Applying Pattern to Other Formatters**
   - The same error handling patterns need to be applied to other formatters
   - JSON, CSV, TAP, JUnit, and other formatters need similar testing

2. **Path Validation in Formatters**
   - Ensure consistent path validation in all formatter modules
   - Add specific error handling for formatter-specific paths

3. **Fixing Instrumentation Errors**
   - Address the "attempt to call a nil value" error in instrumentation tests
   - Focus on proper initialization and nil checking in static_analyzer

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Document formatter error handling patterns
   - Add examples to error handling reference

## Next Steps Recommendation

1. Apply the same standardized error handling to other formatters (JSON, CSV, etc.)
2. Fix the nil value error in instrumentation module by examining lazy loading
3. Update documentation to reflect the formatter error handling patterns
4. Create specific examples for handling file-related errors in formatters

## Conclusion

This session successfully implemented standardized error handling in the HTML formatter and restored previously skipped tests. By creating a comprehensive test suite for formatter error handling, we've established patterns that can be applied across all formatter modules, improving the overall robustness of the reporting system.
