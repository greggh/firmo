# Session Summary: Fix Logger Conditionals in lust-next.lua (Part 3) (2025-03-11)

## Overview

This session continued our work on fixing logger conditionals in lust-next.lua, treating the logger as a required dependency similar to error_handler and filesystem. We made additional progress removing conditional checks from more functions in the file.

## Progress Made

1. **Fixed xdescribe Function**:
   - ✅ Removed all conditional logger checks in parameter validation
   - ✅ Updated error reporting with direct logger usage
   - ✅ Enhanced debug logging to remove conditionals
   - ✅ Fixed error handling for unsuccessful describe block creation

2. **Fixed tags Function**:
   - ✅ Removed conditional checks in debug logging
   - ✅ Updated error handling with direct logger usage
   - ✅ Fixed error propagation with consistent logging patterns

3. **Fixed only_tags Function**:
   - ✅ Removed conditional checks in debug logging
   - ✅ Updated error handling for tag validation errors
   - ✅ Enhanced error reporting with standardized pattern

4. **Fixed filter Function**:
   - ✅ Updated parameter validation to use logger directly
   - ✅ Enhanced debug logging with direct logger usage
   - ✅ Fixed error handling for invalid filter patterns
   - ✅ Ensured consistent error reporting

5. **Fixed reset_filters Function**:
   - ✅ Removed conditional checks in debug logging
   - ✅ Updated error handling with direct logger usage
   - ✅ Enhanced error propagation and reporting

## Implementation Details

1. **Standard Pattern Followed**:
   ```lua
   -- Before:
   if logger then
     logger.error("Error message", {
       context = data
     })
   end
   
   -- After:
   logger.error("Error message", {
     context = data
   })
   ```

2. **Debug Logging Pattern**:
   ```lua
   -- Before:
   if logger and logger.debug then
     logger.debug("Debug message", {
       context = data
     })
   end
   
   -- After:
   logger.debug("Debug message", {
     context = data
   })
   ```

## Remaining Work

Several sections of lust-next.lua still contain conditional logger checks that need to be updated:

1. **Test Functions**:
   - [ ] Fix it function and its variants (fit, xit)
   - [ ] Update before/after hooks
   - [ ] Fix remaining sections dealing with test execution

2. **Test Helper Functions**:
   - [ ] Fix should_run_test and related functions
   - [ ] Update pattern matching functions
   - [ ] Enhance error handling in test result reporting

## Next Steps

To complete this task, we need to:

1. Continue systematically removing the remaining `if logger` and `if logger and logger.debug` conditionals throughout lust-next.lua
2. Run tests to verify the changes work correctly
3. Update the project-wide error handling plan with the completed task
4. Begin implementing error handling in reporting modules

This implementation continues to improve code consistency and simplifies the codebase by treating logger as a required dependency alongside error_handler and filesystem.
