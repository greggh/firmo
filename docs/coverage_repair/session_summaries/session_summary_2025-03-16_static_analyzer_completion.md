## Implementation Details

### Condition Expression Tracking

The condition expression tracking system introduces several key components:

1. **Definition of Conditional Expressions**:
   ```lua
   -- Tags that indicate condition expressions
   local CONDITION_TAGS = {
     Op = true,       -- operators like >, <, ==, ~=, and, or
     Not = true,      -- logical not
     Nil = true,      -- nil checks
     True = true,     -- boolean literal true
     False = true,    -- boolean literal false
     Number = true,   -- number literals in conditions
     String = true,   -- string literals in conditions
     Table = true,    -- table literals in conditions
     Dots = true,     -- vararg expressions
     Id = true,       -- identifiers
     Call = true,     -- function calls
     Invoke = true,   -- method calls
     Index = true,    -- table indexing
     Paren = true,    -- parenthesized expressions
   }
   ```

2. **Recursive Condition Extraction**:
   ```lua
   local function extract_conditions(node, conditions, content, parent_id, is_child)
     -- Process node if it's a conditional operation
     if node and node.tag and CONDITION_TAGS[node.tag] then
       -- Create a unique ID for this condition
       local condition_type = node.tag:lower()
       condition_id = condition_type .. "_" .. (#conditions + 1)
       
       -- Create condition entry with metadata
       local condition = {
         id = condition_id,
         type = condition_type,
         parent_id = parent_id,
         start_line = start_line,
         end_line = end_line,
         is_compound = (node.tag == "Op" and (node[1] == "and" or node[1] == "or")),
         operator = node.tag == "Op" and node[1] or nil,
         components = {},
         executed = false,
         executed_true = false,
         executed_false = false,
         execution_count = 0,
         metadata = { ast_pos = node.pos, ast_end_pos = node.end_pos }
       }
       
       -- For compound conditions, process components recursively
       if node.tag == "Op" and (node[1] == "and" or node[1] == "or") then
         -- Process left and right operands
       elseif node.tag == "Not" then
         -- Process negated expression
       end
     end
   end
   ```

3. **Block Integration**:
   ```lua
   -- Enhanced function to process If blocks with condition tracking
   local function process_if_block(blocks, parent_block, node, content, block_id_counter, parent_id)
     -- Process condition expression
     if node[1] then
       -- Extract all conditions in the expression
       local conditions = extract_conditions(node[1], {}, content, parent_id, false)
       
       -- Link conditions to the parent block
       for _, condition in ipairs(conditions) do
         if condition.parent_id == parent_id then
           table.insert(parent_block.conditions, condition.id)
         end
       end
       
       -- Add all extracted conditions to the blocks array
       for _, condition in ipairs(conditions) do
         table.insert(blocks, condition)
       end
     end
     
     -- Process then and else branches...
   end
   ```

4. **Condition Coverage Metrics**:
   ```lua
   function M.calculate_detailed_condition_coverage(code_map)
     -- Initialize metrics
     local metrics = {
       total_conditions = #code_map.conditions,
       executed_conditions = 0,
       fully_covered_conditions = 0,
       compound_conditions = 0,
       simple_conditions = 0,
       coverage_by_type = {},
       coverage_percent = 0,
       outcome_coverage_percent = 0
     }
     
     -- Analyze condition metrics
     for _, condition in ipairs(code_map.conditions) do
       -- Track by condition type...
       -- Count simple vs compound conditions...
       -- Track execution and outcome coverage...
     end
     
     -- Calculate percentages...
     return metrics
   end
   ```

## Testing

We implemented comprehensive tests in `condition_expression_test.lua` to verify the condition expression tracking system. The tests cover:

1. **Simple Conditions**:
   - Basic comparison operators
   - Type-based conditions
   - Identifier conditions

2. **Compound Conditions**:
   - AND expressions with their components
   - OR expressions with their components
   - NOT operations and their negated expressions

3. **Complex Nested Conditions**:
   - Deeply nested expressions with multiple operators
   - Mixed AND/OR/NOT expressions
   - Parenthesized expressions

4. **Integration with Blocks**:
   - Conditions in if statements
   - Conditions in loops (while, repeat-until)
   - Conditions in flow control

5. **Coverage Metrics**:
   - Basic coverage calculations
   - Detailed metrics by condition type
   - Outcome coverage tracking

All tests passed successfully, validating our implementation of condition expression tracking.

## Next Steps

With the completion of the Static Analyzer improvements, our focus now shifts to the next component of Phase 2:

1. **Debug Hook Enhancements**:
   - Improve line execution data collection
   - Fix function and block execution tracking
   - Implement condition outcome tracking
   - Create more efficient data structures

2. **Execution vs. Coverage Distinction**:
   - Clarify the distinction between executed and covered lines
   - Improve the integration with the static analyzer
   - Enhance reporting of execution vs. coverage

This represents a significant milestone in our coverage module repair plan. The enhanced static analyzer now provides a solid foundation for accurate code coverage analysis, including detailed function, block, and condition coverage metrics.
