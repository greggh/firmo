# Session Summary: Improving Error Handling in Test Output

**Date:** 2025-03-18  
**Focus:** Creating a proper test-aware error handling system

## Overview

In this session, we addressed concerns about our original approach to error message suppression in tests. The initial implementation was overly aggressive, replacing nearly all logging with debug-level logs without proper context awareness. This would have broken the actual error reporting functionality during normal operation.

We implemented a more sophisticated, context-aware approach that:

1. Detects when we're running in a test environment
2. Selectively suppresses expected validation errors during tests
3. Maintains proper error logging during normal operation

## Key Changes

### 1. Test Mode Detection and Configuration

Added test mode detection to error_handler:

```lua
-- Module configuration with test mode flag
local config = {
  -- existing settings...
  in_test_run = false, -- Are we currently running tests?
}

-- Detect if we're running a test by looking at the call stack
local function detect_test_run()
  local info = debug.getinfo(3, "S")
  local source = info and info.source or ""
  return source:match("test") ~= nil
end

-- Set test run mode if we're running tests
config.in_test_run = detect_test_run()
```

Added explicit API for test mode control:

```lua
-- Functions to control test mode
function M.set_test_mode(enabled)
  config.in_test_run = enabled and true or false
  return config.in_test_run
end

function M.is_test_mode()
  return config.in_test_run
end
```

### 2. Context-Aware Error Logging

Implemented sophisticated error logging that adapts to test context:

```lua
-- Check if we should suppress verbose logging in test environment
local log_level = "error"
local suppress_logging = false

-- In test mode, we want to suppress most non-critical errors
if config.in_test_run then 
  -- Check if this is an error from a validation test
  local might_be_test_assertion = 
    (err.category == M.CATEGORY.VALIDATION) or 
    (err.message and err.message:match("expected")) or
    (err.message and err.message:match("VALIDATION")) or
    (err.message and err.message:match("test error"))
  
  -- Errors from test assertions are expected - don't log them as errors
  if might_be_test_assertion then
    suppress_logging = true
  end
end

-- Choose appropriate log level based on context
if err.severity == M.SEVERITY.FATAL then
  log_level = "error" -- Fatal errors are always logged at error level
elseif err.severity == M.SEVERITY.ERROR then
  log_level = suppress_logging and "debug" or "error"
elseif err.severity == M.SEVERITY.WARNING then
  log_level = suppress_logging and "debug" or "warn"
else
  log_level = suppress_logging and "debug" or "info"
end
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Detection in Mocking System

Improved the mock system to better detect test-related errors:

```lua
-- Check if error handler is available to detect test mode
local error_handler_available = error_handler and type(error_handler) == "table" and 
                               type(error_handler.is_test_mode) == "function"

-- Check if we're in test mode and this appears to be a test assertion
local is_test_mode = error_handler_available and error_handler.is_test_mode()
local is_test_assertion = is_test_mode and 
                          (error_during_execution and 
                           ((type(error_during_execution) == "table" and 
                             error_during_execution.category == "VALIDATION") or
                            (type(error_during_execution) == "string" and
                             (error_during_execution:match("expected") or
                              error_during_execution:match("VALIDATION") or
                              error_during_execution:match("Test error")))))
```

### 4. Automatic Test Mode Detection

Modified the test runner to enable test mode automatically:

```lua
-- Set error handler to test mode since we're running tests
error_handler.set_test_mode(true)
```

## Implementation Details

### Error Handler Test Mode Integration

The key insight for our improved approach is distinguishing between errors that are part of test assertions (expected) and those that reflect actual issues (unexpected). In tests, validation errors are often expected since tests are designed to verify error conditions.

Our approach uses multiple signals to identify test assertion errors:
- The error category (VALIDATION indicates a test assertion)
- The error message content (messages containing "expected", "VALIDATION", or "test error")
- The context in which the error occurred (in a test file)

### Benefits Over Previous Approach

Unlike the initial approach that simply downgraded all logs to debug level, this new implementation:

1. Preserves normal error reporting functionality during regular usage
2. Only suppresses errors that appear to be from test assertions
3. Still logs unexpected errors at appropriate levels even during tests
4. Provides explicit APIs for controlling test mode

## Testing

We verified our changes by running:
- Normal test files with expected failures
- Files that test error conditions
- The mocking test suite

## Limitations and Future Improvements

The current approach has a few limitations:

1. It may not perfectly detect all test-related errors
2. Some messages like "table index is nil" still appear in test output
3. The mocking system still shows some expected errors as actual errors

Future improvements could include:
- More sophisticated test pattern detection
- A registry of expected test errors
- Better integration with the test runner to automatically suppress specific errors

## Conclusion

This improved approach to error handling in tests maintains the balance between:
- Keeping test output clean and readable
- Preserving proper error reporting for unexpected issues
- Providing context-aware logging based on the execution environment

Rather than a blanket approach that loses information, we've implemented a selective system that makes informed decisions about which errors to display prominently.
