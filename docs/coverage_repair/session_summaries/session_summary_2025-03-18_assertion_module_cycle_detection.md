# Session Summary: Assertion Module Cycle Detection Fix

## Overview

This session focused on fixing a critical stack overflow issue in the assertion module that was occurring during testing. The issue was caused by a lack of cycle detection in the recursive equality check and stringification functions, which would enter an infinite recursion when comparing or displaying objects with circular references.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Cycle Detection to Deep Equality Check

- Enhanced `M.eq()` function to detect and handle circular references
- Implemented a visit tracking mechanism using a shared table across recursive calls
- Added handling for direct table references for faster equality checking
- Ensured cycles are detected and assumed equal for consistency

### 2. Added Cycle Detection to Table Stringification

- Updated `stringify()` function to track visited tables during recursion
- Added special handling for circular references with a clear "[Circular Reference]" indicator
- Ensured the visited table is properly shared across recursive calls
- Limited recursion depth for better performance and readability

### 3. Fixed the Diff Values Function

- Updated `diff_values()` function to use the enhanced stringify with cycle detection
- Ensured consistent use of the visited table across all stringify calls
- Improved the error formatting for better readability

## Implementation Details

The key implementation pattern for cycle detection is a "visited table" approach:

```lua
function M.eq(t1, t2, eps, visited)
  -- Initialize visited tables on first call
  visited = visited or {}
  
  -- Direct reference equality check
  if t1 == t2 then
    return true
  end
  
  -- Create a unique key for this comparison pair
  if type(t1) == "table" and type(t2) == "table" then
    local pair_key = tostring(t1) .. ":" .. tostring(t2)
    
    -- If we've seen this pair before, we're in a cycle
    if visited[pair_key] then
      return true -- Assume equality for cyclic structures
    end
    
    -- Mark this pair as visited
    visited[pair_key] = true
  end
  
  -- Continue with regular deep equality checking...
```

A similar approach was used for the `stringify` function:

```lua
function stringify(t, depth, visited)
  -- Initialize tracking
  visited = visited or {}
  
  -- Handle cyclic references
  if visited[t] then
    return "[Circular Reference]"
  end
  
  -- Mark this table as visited
  visited[t] = true
  
  -- Continue with regular stringification...
```

## Results

- Successfully fixed stack overflow in the assertion module
- All tests now pass without any recursion-related errors
- Added proper cycle detection to prevent future stack overflow issues
- Improved error messages for objects with circular references

The fix was verified with the `/tests/core/type_checking_test.lua` test, which now passes successfully even when comparing objects with circular references.

## Impact on the Codebase

- **Stability**: The assertion module is now more robust with proper handling of circular structures
- **Error Messages**: Better formatting of error messages for objects with circular references
- **Testing**: More reliable testing of complex objects that may contain cycles
- **Performance**: Prevented potential performance issues from infinite recursion

## Next Steps

1. Add more comprehensive tests for circular reference handling
2. Review other parts of the codebase that may have similar recursive patterns
3. Consider adding a more comprehensive cycle detection solution that could be shared across modules
4. Update documentation to mention the support for cyclic structures in equality checking
