# Session Summary: Static Analyzer Line Classification Improvements (2025-03-14)

## Overview

This session focused on implementing Phase 2 of the coverage repair plan, specifically enhancing the line classification system in the static analyzer module. The work included fixing several environment issues, creating comprehensive test suites, and implementing significant improvements to the line classification algorithms. These changes enable more accurate tracking of executable lines, which is critical for correct coverage reporting.

## Key Changes

1. **Test Suite Creation**
   - Created a comprehensive test suite for static analyzer error handling
   - Implemented a focused test suite for line classification
   - Fixed test environment issues (file path handling, mocking approaches)

2. **Module Error Fixes**
   - Fixed syntax errors in the watcher.lua file by replacing curly braces with proper 'end' keywords
   - Fixed module loading issues in interactive.lua to properly handle the discover and runner modules

3. **Line Classification Improvements**
   - Implemented the missing `classify_line_simple` function for cases where AST analysis isn't available
   - Enhanced the `is_line_executable` function with better comment and string detection
   - Improved multiline comment detection and integration with line classification
   - Added handling for control flow keywords based on configuration
   - Added support for proper string and comment detection in mixed contexts

4. **Public API Enhancements**
   - Exposed `is_line_executable` as a public API function
   - Added a `get_executable_lines` helper function to get all executable lines for a file
   - Enhanced `is_in_multiline_comment` to support direct content analysis
   - Improved code map generation to include content and AST nodes

## Implementation Details

### Line Classification System

The line classification system was enhanced with a two-tier approach:

1. **AST-based Classification (Primary)**
```lua
function M.is_line_executable(code_map, line_num)
  if not code_map or not line_num then
    return false
  end
  
  -- Make sure we have content and AST nodes
  local content = code_map.content
  local nodes = code_map.nodes
  
  if not content or not nodes then
    return false
  end
  
  -- Delegate to the internal implementation
  return is_line_executable(nodes, line_num, content)
end
```

2. **Pattern-based Classification (Fallback)**
```lua
function M.classify_line_simple(line_text, options)
  -- Handle nil input
  if not line_text then
    return false
  end
  
  options = options or {}
  
  -- Strip whitespace for easier pattern matching
  local trimmed = line_text:match("^%s*(.-)%s*$") or ""
  
  -- Empty lines are not executable
  if trimmed == "" then
    return false
  end
  
  -- Check for comments (entire line is comment)
  if trimmed:match("^%-%-") then
    return false
  end
  
  -- Additional checks for various code constructs
  -- ...
end
```

### Multiline Comment Integration

The `is_in_multiline_comment` function was enhanced to support direct content analysis:

```lua
function M.is_in_multiline_comment(file_path, line_num, content)
  -- Handle case where content is provided directly (for AST-based analysis)
  if content and line_num and line_num > 0 then
    -- Process content directly to find multiline comments
    local context = M.create_multiline_comment_context()
    
    -- Split content into lines for processing
    local lines = {}
    for line in (content .. "\n"):gmatch("([^\r\n]*)[\r\n]") do
      table.insert(lines, line)
    end
    
    -- Process each line to mark comment status up to our target line
    for i = 1, math.min(line_num, #lines) do
      M.process_line_for_comments(lines[i], i, context)
    end
    
    -- Return the status for our target line
    return context.line_status[line_num] or false
  end
  
  -- Traditional file-based approach continues...
```

### Code Map Enhancement

The code map generation was updated to include content and AST nodes:

```lua
local code_map = {
  lines = {},           -- Information about each line
  functions = {},       -- Function definitions with line ranges
  branches = {},        -- Branch points (if/else, loops)
  blocks = {},          -- Code blocks for block-based coverage
  content = content,    -- Store the content for line classification
  nodes = {},           -- Store the AST nodes for line classification
  conditions = {},      -- Conditional expressions for condition coverage
  line_count = count_lines(content)
}

-- Later in the function:
code_map.nodes = all_nodes
```

## Testing

Two test suites were implemented to verify the changes:

1. **Error Handling Test Suite**
   - `tests/error_handling/coverage/static_analyzer_test.lua`
   - Tests for initialization, file validation, content processing, etc.
   - Verifies proper error handling for invalid inputs, large files, etc.

2. **Line Classification Test Suite**
   - `tests/coverage/line_classification_test.lua`
   - Tests specifically focused on line classification
   - Covers comments, control flow, function definitions, tables, and complex cases
   - Verifies proper classification based on configuration

The tests showed significant improvements in line classification accuracy, though a few edge cases remain to be addressed in future sessions.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Module Loading Issues

The interactive.lua module was attempting to load modules that don't exist in the library context (`discover` and `runner`), causing distracting error messages during tests. 

**Solution**: Modified the module loading approach to explicitly acknowledge these modules are used in the CLI context but not in the library context:

```lua
-- These modules are loaded directly in the CLI version but not needed in the library context
local has_discovery, discover = false, nil
local has_runner, runner = false, nil
```

### Syntax Errors in Watcher Module

Several syntax errors were found in the watcher.lua file where curly braces were used instead of proper Lua 'end' keywords:

**Solution**: Fixed all instances by replacing `}` with `end` at lines 1147, 1187, and 1267.

### Multiline String Detection

Accurately detecting content within multiline strings proved challenging due to nesting and mixed context.

**Solution**: Implemented a more robust detection mechanism that tracks string boundaries and properly identifies content lines:

```lua
-- Multi-line string detection
local in_multiline_string = false
for i = 1, line_num - 1 do
  local prev_line = content:match("[^\r\n]*", i) or ""
  if prev_line:match("%[%[") and not prev_line:match("%]%]") then
    -- A multi-line string started and didn't end
    in_multiline_string = true
  elseif prev_line:match("%]%]") and in_multiline_string then
    -- The multi-line string ended
    in_multiline_string = false
  end
end
```

## Next Steps

1. **Function Detection Improvements**
   - Enhance function name extraction logic
   - Improve tracking of anonymous functions
   - Better handle methods in table definitions
   - Add function metadata collection

2. **Block Boundary Identification**
   - Implement stack-based block tracking
   - Enhance block identification algorithm
   - Create proper parent-child relationships

3. **Condition Expression Tracking**
   - Enhance condition expression detection
   - Implement condition outcome tracking

4. **Line Classification Refinements**
   - Fix remaining edge cases with comment and string detection
   - Enhance pattern matching in the simple classifier
   - Add more test cases for complex scenarios
