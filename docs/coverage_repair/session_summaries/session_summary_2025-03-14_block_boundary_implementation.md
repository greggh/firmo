# Block Boundary Implementation - Session Summary (2025-03-14)

## Overview

This session focused on implementing the stack-based block boundary identification system as part of Phase 2 of the coverage repair project. We successfully enhanced the static analyzer to properly detect and track different types of code blocks, including if-else blocks, loops, functions, and do blocks. The implementation establishes proper parent-child relationships between blocks and adds comprehensive metadata for improved coverage tracking.

## Key Changes

1. Created a comprehensive test suite for block boundary detection
2. Implemented a stack-based block tracking algorithm
3. Enhanced the AST traversal to properly handle nested blocks
4. Added special case handling for different block types (if, while, repeat, for, function)
5. Established parent-child relationships between blocks
6. Added detailed metadata for each block
7. Updated documentation to reflect the progress

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Block Detection Algorithm

The core implementation involves a complete rewrite of the `find_blocks` function using a recursive approach for better AST traversal:

```lua
local function find_blocks(ast, blocks, content, parent_id)
  -- Initialize blocks and parent_id
  blocks = blocks or {}
  parent_id = parent_id or "root"
  
  -- Process AST with a recursive function
  local function process_node(node, parent_id, depth, is_function_child)
    -- Add a block for this node if it's a block type
    if node.tag and BLOCK_TAGS[node.tag] and node.pos and node.end_pos then
      -- Create block entry with metadata
      local block = {
        id = block_id,
        type = node.tag,
        start_line = start_line,
        end_line = end_line,
        parent_id = parent_id,
        children = {},
        branches = {},
        conditions = {},
        metadata = { ... },
        executed = false
      }
      
      -- Special handling for different block types
      if node.tag == "If" then
        process_if_block(blocks, block, node, content, block_id_counter, block_id)
      elseif node.tag == "While" then
        process_while_block(blocks, block, node, content, block_id_counter, block_id)
      -- etc. for other block types
      end
      
      -- Add the block and process children
      table.insert(blocks, block)
      for i = 1, #node do
        process_node(node[i], block_id, depth + 1, node.tag == "Function")
      end
    else
      -- Process children for non-block nodes
      for i = 1, #node do
        process_node(node[i], parent_id, depth, is_function_child)
      end
    end
  end
  
  -- Start processing with the root node
  process_node(ast, parent_id, 0, false)
  
  -- Establish parent-child relationships
  build_block_hierarchy(blocks)
  
  return blocks
end
```

### Special Case Handlers

We implemented specialized handlers for different block types:

1. **If Blocks**: Processes condition, then branch, and else branch
2. **While Loops**: Processes condition and body
3. **Repeat Loops**: Processes body and until condition
4. **For Loops**: Processes range/iterator and body
5. **Function Blocks**: Adds parameter and metadata information

Each handler extracts relevant metadata and creates appropriate sub-blocks:

```lua
local function process_if_block(blocks, parent_block, node, content, block_id_counter, parent_id)
  -- Process condition
  local condition_id = add_condition_block(...)
  table.insert(parent_block.conditions, condition_id)
  
  -- Process then branch
  local then_id = add_then_block(...)
  table.insert(parent_block.branches, then_id)
  
  -- Process else branch
  local else_id = add_else_block(...)
  table.insert(parent_block.branches, else_id)
end
```

### AST Structure Handling

A key insight was understanding the nested structure of the AST:

```
AST (Block)
 └── Localrec (local function definition)
     └── Function (the function body)
         └── Block (function block)
             └── If (if statement)
                 ├── Condition
                 ├── Block (then)
                 └── Block (else)
```

We addressed this by implementing special case handling for common AST patterns, such as:
- Local function declarations (Localrec)
- Function assignments (Set)
- Method declarations with colon syntax
- Nested blocks within control structures

## Testing

We created a comprehensive test suite that verifies:

1. **Basic Block Detection**: Tests if-else blocks and functions
2. **Nested Block Detection**: Tests blocks inside other blocks
3. **Parent-Child Relationships**: Verifies correct nesting
4. **Block Types**: Tests all Lua block types (if, while, repeat, for, function, do)
5. **Complex Nesting**: Tests deeply nested structures
6. **Block Boundaries**: Verifies that start/end lines are correct

The tests use temporary files to create isolated test environments and validate that the block detection algorithm correctly identifies all types of blocks and their relationships.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: AST Structure Complexity

The AST provided by the parser has a nested structure where blocks are often not directly represented at the top level. For example, an if statement is not a direct child of the root node but is nested within a function body block.

**Solution:** We implemented a recursive processing approach that traverses the entire AST and identifies blocks at all levels, regardless of nesting depth.

### Challenge 2: Special Block Types

Different block types have different internal structures in the AST. For example, an if block has condition, then, and else components, while a for loop has range and body components.

**Solution:** We created specialized handlers for each block type, extracting the relevant components and creating appropriate sub-blocks with accurate boundaries.

### Challenge 3: Parent-Child Relationships

Establishing correct parent-child relationships was challenging, especially with deeply nested blocks.

**Solution:** We implemented a post-processing step that builds a block map and correctly links children to their parents based on the block_id references.

### Challenge 4: Boundary Detection

Accurately determining the start and end lines for each block was difficult, especially for conditional expressions and loop boundaries.

**Solution:** We enhanced the line mapping system to more accurately convert AST node positions to line numbers, and added validation to ensure that only valid blocks with proper boundaries are included.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Condition Expression Tracking**:
   - Enhance the condition expression detection to identify compound conditions
   - Decompose conditions into individual components (a and b, a or b)
   - Add tracking for condition outcomes (true/false)
   - Connect conditions to their containing blocks

2. **Debug Hook Enhancements**:
   - Integrate the improved block detection with the debug hook
   - Implement block-level execution tracking
   - Add condition outcome tracking

3. **Add Integration Tests**:
   - Create tests that verify the integration between block detection and execution tracking
   - Test complex scenarios with deeply nested blocks and conditions

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update the API documentation to reflect the new block tracking capabilities
   - Add examples of block-level coverage tracking
