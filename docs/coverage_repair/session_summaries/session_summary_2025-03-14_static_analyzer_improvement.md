# Session Summary: Static Analyzer Improvements (2025-03-14)

## Overview

This session implemented key improvements to the static analyzer module as part of Phase 2 of the coverage repair plan. The work focused on enhancing the line classification system, improving multiline comment detection, and implementing missing functions identified during the test suite creation.

## Key Tasks Completed

1. **Line Classification System Improvements**
   - Implemented the missing `classify_line_simple` function for cases where AST analysis isn't available
   - Enhanced the `is_line_executable` function with better comment and string detection
   - Added specific handling for multiline strings
   - Improved detection of control flow keywords based on configuration

2. **Multiline Comment Detection Enhancements**
   - Updated `is_in_multiline_comment` to support direct content analysis
   - Enhanced the algorithm to better detect nested comments and mixed code/comments
   - Added error handling for various edge cases

3. **Code Map Generation Enhancements**
   - Updated the code map to include content and nodes for line classification
   - Exposed `is_line_executable` as a public API in the module
   - Added a `get_executable_lines` function to get all executable lines for a file

4. **Test Suite Implementation**
   - Created a comprehensive test suite for line classification
   - Added tests for various code constructs including comments, control flow, function definitions, tables
   - Implemented tests for edge cases and mixed code constructs

## Technical Details

### Line Classification System

The improved line classification system now uses a two-tier approach:

1. **AST-based Classification** (Primary)
   - Uses the AST nodes to determine if a line contains executable code
   - More accurate but requires successful parsing

2. **Pattern-based Classification** (Fallback)
   - Simple pattern matching for when AST analysis isn't available
   - Less accurate but works with syntax errors or partial files

The primary enhancements to the `is_line_executable` function include:

```lua
function M.is_line_executable(code_map, line_num)
  if not code_map or not line_num then
    return false
  end
  
  -- Make sure we have content and AST nodes
  local content = code_map.content
  local nodes = code_map.nodes
  
  if not content or not nodes then
    return false
  end
  
  -- Delegate to the internal implementation
  return is_line_executable(nodes, line_num, content)
end
```

The internal implementation was enhanced with:

1. Better extraction of line text
2. Multiline comment detection
3. Single-line comment detection
4. Control flow keyword handling based on configuration
5. Multiline string detection

### Multiline Comment Detection

The `is_in_multiline_comment` function was expanded to support direct content analysis:

```lua
function M.is_in_multiline_comment(file_path, line_num, content)
  -- Handle case where content is provided directly (for AST-based analysis)
  if content and line_num and line_num > 0 then
    -- Process content directly to find multiline comments
    local context = M.create_multiline_comment_context()
    
    -- Split content into lines for processing
    local lines = {}
    for line in (content .. "\n"):gmatch("([^\r\n]*)[\r\n]") do
      table.insert(lines, line)
    end
    
    -- Process each line to mark comment status up to our target line
    for i = 1, math.min(line_num, #lines) do
      M.process_line_for_comments(lines[i], i, context)
    end
    
    -- Return the status for our target line
    return context.line_status[line_num] or false
  end
  
  -- Traditional file-based approach continues...
```

### Code Map Generation

The code map structure was enhanced to include:

```lua
local code_map = {
  lines = {},           -- Information about each line
  functions = {},       -- Function definitions with line ranges
  branches = {},        -- Branch points (if/else, loops)
  blocks = {},          -- Code blocks for block-based coverage
  content = content,    -- Store the content for line classification
  nodes = {},           -- Store the AST nodes for line classification
  conditions = {},      -- Conditional expressions for condition coverage
  line_count = count_lines(content)
}
```

This allows the line classification system to work directly with the code map without requiring additional file I/O or processing.

## Test Suite

A comprehensive test suite was implemented in `tests/coverage/line_classification_test.lua` covering:

1. **Comments**
   - Single-line comments
   - Multiline comments
   - Nested comments
   - Mixed code and comments

2. **Control Flow**
   - if/then/else/end structures
   - for loops
   - while loops
   - repeat-until loops
   - standalone control flow keywords

3. **Function Definitions**
   - Local function definitions
   - Global function definitions
   - Anonymous function assignments
   - Table function definitions

4. **Table Definitions**
   - Key-value tables
   - Array-style tables

5. **Complex Cases**
   - Chained method calls
   - Multi-line strings
   - Multi-line function calls
   - Require statements

6. **Configuration**
   - Testing how control_flow_keywords_executable affects classification

## Results and Observations

The initial tests show significant improvement in line classification, though some edge cases still need refinement:

1. Multiline string detection works well for most cases but has some edge cases
2. Empty lines and comments are now properly classified as non-executable
3. Control flow keywords are now classified correctly based on configuration
4. Function definitions and table definitions are properly classified

Some remaining issues to address in future sessions:

1. Better handling of nested multiline comments
2. Improved detection of non-executable lines within multiline strings
3. More accurate classification of control flow keywords at edges of blocks

## Next Steps

1. **Function Detection Improvements**
   - Enhance function name extraction
   - Better handle anonymous functions and methods
   - Add function metadata collection

2. **Block Boundary Identification**
   - Implement stack-based block tracking
   - Create proper parent-child relationships
   - Enhance block metadata for reporting

3. **Condition Expression Tracking**
   - Enhance condition expression detection
   - Implement condition outcome tracking

4. **Additional Line Classification Refinements**
   - Fix remaining issues with comment and string detection
   - Enhance pattern matching in the simple classifier
   - Add more test cases for edge scenarios
