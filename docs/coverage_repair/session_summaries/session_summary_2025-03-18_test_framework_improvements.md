# Session Summary: Test Framework Improvements

**Date:** March 18, 2025  
**Topic:** Standardizing error testing patterns across the codebase  
**Status:** Completed  

## Overview

This session focused on improving the test framework by standardizing error testing patterns, fixing log output for expected errors, and resolving inconsistencies in test summary reporting. These improvements contribute to Phase 5 (Codebase-Wide Standardization) in the consolidated plan.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed ERROR logs for expected errors

**Problem:** When using the `expect_error` flag in test cases, ERROR logs still appeared in the test output, creating confusion between expected errors and actual test failures.

**Solution:**
- Modified the error_handler module to intelligently handle logging for expected errors
- Added special handling for tests with `expect_error = true` flag
- Implemented a balanced approach that:
  - Downgrades ERROR/WARNING logs to DEBUG level
  - Only outputs logs if debug logging is explicitly enabled
  - Preserves debugging information when needed

**Key changes:**
```lua
-- When in a test with expect_error flag, handle errors specially
if completely_skip_logging then
  -- Store the error in a global table for potential debugging if needed
  _G._firmo_test_errors = _G._firmo_test_errors or {}
  table.insert(_G._firmo_test_errors, err)
  
  -- Don't skip all logging - only downgrade ERROR and WARNING logs to DEBUG
  -- This allows explicit debug logging to still work
  if err.severity == M.SEVERITY.ERROR or err.severity == M.SEVERITY.WARNING then
    log_level = "debug"
  end
  
  -- Additionally check if debug logs are explicitly enabled
  local debug_enabled = logger.is_debug_enabled and logger.is_debug_enabled()
  if not debug_enabled then
    -- If debug logs aren't enabled, skip logging entirely
    return
  end
  -- Otherwise, continue with debug-level logging
end
```

### 2. Updated coverage module tests with standardized error pattern

Updated various tests to follow the standardized error testing pattern:

- Updated static_analyzer_test.lua:
  - File validation tests
  - Content processing tests
  - Multiline comment detection tests

- Added error tests to instrumentation_test.lua:
  - Non-existent file handling
  - Invalid Lua code handling
  - File size limit checking

- Updated instrumentation_module_test.lua:
  - Added error handling tests for invalid predicates
  - Added tests for errors in require hooks

The standardized pattern is:
```lua
it("test case description", { expect_error = true }, function()
  local result, err = test_helper.with_error_capture(function()
    return function_that_should_error()
  end)()
  
  expect(result).to_not.exist()
  expect(err).to.exist()
  expect(err.category).to.exist() -- Avoid overly specific category expectations
end)
```

### 3. Resolved test summary inconsistencies

**Problem:** The test runner reported inconsistent metrics - `passes` vs `tests_passed` and `failures` vs `tests_failed` - causing confusion in test reporting.

**Solution:**
- Modified runner.lua to use consistent terminology across all reporting
- Ensured both metrics (`passes`/`tests_passed` and `failures`/`tests_failed`) are available in all summaries
- Added clear comments explaining the terminology
- Created test_summary_check.lua script to verify consistency

**Key changes:**
```lua
-- In the summary, use consistent terminology:
-- - passes/failures => individual test cases passed/failed
-- - files_passed/files_failed => test files that passed/failed
logger.info("Test run summary", {
  files_passed = passed_files,
  files_failed = failed_files,
  tests_passed = total_passes, -- Same as 'passes' 
  tests_failed = total_failures, -- Same as 'failures'
  tests_skipped = total_skipped,
  passes = total_passes, -- Add these for consistency
  failures = total_failures, -- Add these for consistency 
  elapsed_time_seconds = string.format("%.2f", elapsed_time),
})
```

### 4. Documented error testing best practices

Added comprehensive error testing best practices to CLAUDE.md:
- How to use the `expect_error` flag
- Proper use of `test_helper.with_error_capture()`
- Guidelines for making flexible assertions
- Handling different error return patterns (nil+error vs false)
- Resource cleanup in tests
- Proper documentation of expected errors

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Test Output:** No more misleading ERROR logs for expected errors
2. **Consistent Error Testing:** Standardized pattern across the entire codebase
3. **More Resilient Tests:** Less brittle assertions about error details
4. **Consistent Reporting:** Clear test summary with consistent terminology
5. **Better Debugging:** Preserved ability to see debug logs when needed
6. **Documented Best Practices:** Clear guidelines for future development

## Next Steps

1. Update reporting tests with the standardized error testing pattern
2. Continue to maintain and enforce the error testing standards for new test files
3. Consider adding linting rules to enforce the error testing patterns
