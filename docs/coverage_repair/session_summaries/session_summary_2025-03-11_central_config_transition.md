# Session Summary: Transition to Centralized Configuration (2025-03-11)

## Overview

With the completion of formatter integration in our previous session, we have now transitioned the framework fully to use the centralized configuration system. In this session, we completed the final step of this transition by removing dependence on the legacy config.lua module and updating all code to use central_config directly.

## Work Completed

1. **Legacy Config Module Deprecation**
   - Implemented a redirector bridge in lib/core/config.lua that shows deprecation warnings
   - Made the legacy module forward all calls to central_config
   - Added clear warnings about deprecated status

2. **Error Handler Module Update**
   - Updated error_handler.lua to use central_config directly
   - Added fallback to legacy config for backward compatibility
   - Enhanced configure_from_config() to prioritize central_config

3. **Test File Updates**
   - Rewrote config_test.lua to use central_config directly
   - Added tests for schema validation and change listeners
   - Removed all direct references to the legacy config module

4. **Main Framework Updates**
   - Updated lust-next.lua to use central_config directly
   - Added proper registration of core modules with central_config
   - Implemented CLI options for configuration handling (--config, --create-config)
   - Added help text for configuration options
   - Added fallback to legacy config for backward compatibility

5. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated interfaces.md to mark the transition to central_config as complete
   - Added details about the deprecation of the legacy config module
   - Created this session summary document

## Implementation Details

### Legacy Config Module Deprecation Strategy

Our approach to deprecating the legacy config.lua module was to:

1. **Keep Backward Compatibility**: We've maintained all legacy API functions while forwarding calls to the central_config module.
2. **Show Clear Warnings**: Added deprecation warnings using the logging system when legacy calls are made.
3. **Provide Migration Path**: The bridge module recommends using central_config directly and explains the transition.

This approach allows a gradual transition rather than a breaking change, as existing code will continue to work while showing deprecation warnings.

### Configuration Loading Flow

The updated configuration loading flow is now:

1. Try loading from central_config.lua directly
2. If central_config is available, configure the system
3. Only fall back to legacy config if central_config isn't available
4. Show warnings when legacy paths are used

This ensures new code uses the centralized system while keeping old code working.

### Integration with CLI Arguments

We've enhanced the CLI arguments handling to support configuration:

```
Configuration Options:
  --config FILE    Load configuration from specified file
  --create-config  Create default configuration file (.lust-next-config.lua)
```

These options interact directly with central_config, bypassing the legacy module entirely.

## Next Steps

With the centralized configuration system fully implemented and the legacy config module deprecated, our next steps are:

1. **Create Formatter Configuration Test Cases**: Create comprehensive tests for formatter configuration
2. **Update Formatter Documentation**: Provide complete documentation for all formatter configuration options
3. **Improve User Experience**: Create guides for configuring the system

The framework now has a robust, centralized configuration system with schema validation, change notifications, and consistent access patterns across all modules. This represents a significant architectural improvement over the previous configuration approach.

## Conclusion

The transition to the centralized configuration system is now complete. All components and modules in the framework use central_config either directly or through backward-compatible bridges. The legacy config.lua module is now deprecated and will be removed in a future version once sufficient time has passed for users to migrate to the new system.
