# Session Summary: Static Analyzer Improvements (2025-03-14)

## Overview

This session focused on implementing Phase 2 of the coverage repair plan, specifically addressing the static analyzer improvements. The work involved creating a comprehensive test suite for the static analyzer module and fixing issues in the implementation.

## Key Tasks Completed

1. **Test Suite Creation**
   - Created a comprehensive test suite for the static analyzer module
   - Implemented tests for file validation, error handling, line classification, function detection, block detection, and condition tracking
   - Ensured tests cover both successful and error scenarios

2. **Fix Critical Issues**
   - Fixed syntax errors in the watcher.lua file (replaced curly braces with proper 'end' keywords)
   - Fixed string delimiter issues in the test file by using [=[ ]=] instead of [[ ]] for multiline strings

3. **Test Failures Analysis**
   - Identified several areas where tests don't match the actual implementation:
     - Line classification: There are discrepancies between expected and actual line classification
     - Function detection: The function name detection isn't working as expected
     - Block detection: Block structures aren't being properly detected
     - Condition tracking: Condition expressions aren't being properly tracked

## Technical Details

### Issues Fixed

1. **Syntax Errors in watcher.lua**:
   - Line 1147: `}` replaced with `end`
   - Line 1187: `}` replaced with `end`
   - Line 1267: (Another instance needs to be fixed)

2. **String Delimiter Issues**:
   - Modified all multiline strings in the test file to use the [=[ ]=] delimiter format instead of [[ ]] to properly handle nested comment markers

### Test Failures Analysis

1. **Filesystem Functions**:
   - The test is attempting to use `filesystem.remove_file()` and `filesystem.remove_directory()` functions which don't appear to exist
   - Need to identify the correct functions for file/directory cleanup

2. **Mocking Issues**:
   - The test uses `mock.spy()` but there are errors indicating this function doesn't exist or doesn't work as expected
   - Need to review the mocking approach in the test file

3. **Line Classification Discrepancies**:
   - Several tests for `is_line_executable` are failing because the actual classification doesn't match expectations
   - This indicates potential issues in the line classification system that needs to be improved

4. **Block Detection Issues**:
   - Tests are expecting block detection functionality that may not be implemented yet
   - Need to enhance the block detection logic in the static analyzer

5. **Condition Expression Tracking**:
   - Tests for condition expressions are failing, suggesting this feature may be incomplete

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Remaining Syntax Issues**
   - Complete fixing the syntax error in watcher.lua at line 1267

2. **Update Test File**
   - Fix filesystem function calls to use the correct API
   - Update mocking approach to use proper functions and patterns
   - Adjust expectations to match the current implementation state

3. **Static Analyzer Improvements**
   - Enhance line classification system to better distinguish between executable and non-executable lines
   - Improve function detection to correctly identify and name functions
   - Implement block detection with proper boundary identification
   - Develop condition expression tracking

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Create focused test files for specific features once they're implemented
   - Implement regression tests to ensure fixes don't break existing functionality

## Conclusion

The session made significant progress in setting up the test infrastructure for Phase 2 of the coverage repair plan. While the tests currently reveal implementation gaps, they provide a clear roadmap for the enhancements needed. The next sessions will focus on addressing each of the identified areas to improve the static analyzer's accuracy and functionality.
