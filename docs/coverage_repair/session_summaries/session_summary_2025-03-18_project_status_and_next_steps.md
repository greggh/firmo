   - Added proper error context and propagation

3. **Error Handling Test Suite** ✅
   - Created tests for error scenarios in coverage subsystems
   - Verified error propagation across module boundaries
   - Tested recovery mechanisms and fallbacks
   - Fixed mock system errors during test execution
   - Created the test_helper module for standardized error testing

### Phase 2: Static Analysis & Debug Hook Enhancements

This phase has also been completed:

1. **Static Analyzer Improvements** ✅
   - Fixed the line classification system
   - Improved function detection accuracy
   - Corrected block boundary identification
   - Fixed condition expression tracking

2. **Debug Hook Enhancements** ✅
   - Fixed data collection and representation
   - Resolved inconsistencies between execution and coverage
   - Fixed performance monitoring issues
   - Enhanced instrumentation error handling

### Phase 3: Coverage Data Accuracy & Reporting (Current Focus)

This phase is partially complete:

1. **Coverage Data Accuracy** (In Progress)
   - Fixed underlying coverage data tracking for execution vs. coverage
   - Corrected debug hook's processing of line execution events
   - Some issues still exist with metadata handling for source code in reports
   - Need to ensure consistent behavior across all file types

2. **HTML Formatter Enhancements** (Partially Complete)
   - Added hover tooltips for execution count display ✅
   - Implemented visualization for block execution frequency ✅
   - Added distinct visual styles for the four coverage states ✅
   - Implemented filtering capabilities in HTML reports ✅
   - Fixed source code display in HTML reports ✅
   - Still need to enhance coverage source view with better navigation
   - Still need to modernize HTML reports with Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js

3. **Report Validation** (Complete) ✅
   - Created validation mechanisms for data integrity
   - Implemented automated testing of report formats
   - Added schema validation for report data structures

4. **User Experience Improvements** (Partially Complete)
   - Added customization options for report appearance ✅
   - Created collapsible views for code blocks ✅
   - Still need to add heat map visualization for execution frequency
   - Still need to implement responsive design for all screen sizes

## Test System Improvements

Significant improvements have been made to the test system:

1. **Test Error Handling** ✅
   - Implemented context-aware error handling for test output
   - Added test mode detection in error_handler
   - Fixed unreliable test detection via pattern matching
   - Implemented test-level error suppression for intentional error tests

2. **Test Helper Module** ✅
   - Created lib/tools/test_helper.lua with utilities for testing error conditions
   - Implemented with_error_capture() for safely testing error scenarios
   - Added expect_error() for verifying functions throw specific errors
   - Enhanced test readability and reliability

3. **Test Documentation** ✅
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with best practices for error testing
   - Enhanced error_handling_reference.md with test-specific guidance
   - Created example files demonstrating proper error testing patterns

## Next Steps

Based on the current project status, we recommend the following next steps:

### Immediate Priorities (Phase 3 Completion)

1. **Complete HTML Formatter Enhancements**
   - Enhance coverage source view with better navigation
   - Implement responsive design for better mobile compatibility
   - Add heat map visualization for execution frequency

2. **Coverage Data Consistency**
   - Ensure consistent behavior across all file types
   - Fix remaining metadata handling issues in reports
   - Verify correct tracking of execution vs. coverage data

3. **Test Summary Improvements**
   - Resolve the inconsistency between files_failed and tests_failed reporting
   - Add visual indicators for tests that intentionally test errors
   - Improve test summary output to distinguish expected errors from actual failures

### Medium-Term Priorities (Phase 4)

1. **Instrumentation Approach**
   - Complete refactoring for clarity and stability
   - Fix sourcemap handling for error reporting
   - Enhance module require instrumentation

2. **Integration Improvements**
   - Create pre-commit hooks for coverage checks
   - Add continuous integration examples
   - Implement automated performance validation

3. **Final Documentation**
   - Update API documentation with examples
   - Create integration guide for external projects
   - Complete comprehensive testing guide

## Recommendations

Based on our analysis, we recommend focusing on completing Phase 3 first, specifically:

1. Start with the HTML formatter enhancements, focusing on adding better navigation to the coverage source view. This will provide immediate value to users while we work on the more complex issues.

2. Address the coverage data consistency issues to ensure accurate reporting across different file types and test scenarios.

3. Improve the test summary output to better distinguish between expected test failures (when testing error conditions) and actual unexpected failures.

These changes will provide the most immediate benefit to users while setting the stage for the more extensive Phase 4 improvements.

## Conclusion

The firmo coverage module repair project has made significant progress across all planned phases. With Phase 1 and Phase 2 completed, and substantial progress on Phase 3, the project is well-positioned to deliver a comprehensive, reliable coverage module with enhanced reporting capabilities. The focus should now be on completing the remaining Phase 3 tasks to deliver a complete, polished user experience before moving on to Phase 4's extended functionality.
