# Coverage Data Tracking Enhancement Session Summary

## Overview

This session focused on implementing a comprehensive solution to address the coverage data tracking issues, specifically enhancing the distinction between code execution and coverage validation. The primary goal was to ensure that the debug hook and coverage module accurately track and distinguish between lines that are executed during tests versus lines that are both executed and validated by test assertions.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Debug Hook Line Tracking

The `track_line` function in `lib/coverage/debug_hook.lua` was completely rewritten with the following improvements:

```lua
function M.track_line(file_path, line_num, options)
  -- Enhanced with options parameter to explicitly control:
  -- - is_executable: Whether the line is executable code (vs. comments)
  -- - is_covered: Whether the line is considered covered by assertions
  -- - execution_count: For tracking how many times a line executes
  -- - track_blocks/track_conditions: To control advanced tracking
end
```

This new approach addresses the reliability issues with the debug hook by providing a robust API that doesn't rely solely on `debug.sethook()` for line tracking.

### 2. Explicit Coverage Marking API

Added a new function to explicitly mark lines as covered (validated by assertions):

```lua
function M.mark_line_covered(file_path, line_num)
  -- Specific function for marking a line as covered by test assertions
  -- This is the key to distinguishing execution from coverage
end
```

This function enables the testing framework to explicitly mark lines that are validated by assertions, establishing a clear distinction between execution and coverage.

### 3. Debug Hook Enhancement

Redesigned the main `debug_hook` function with clear separation of execution and coverage tracking:

```lua
function M.debug_hook(event, line)
  -- For line events:
  -- 1. Always track execution with M.track_line()
  -- 2. Track as covered only if appropriate based on context
  -- 3. Use enhanced options parameter to control behavior
end
```

This implementation addresses the unreliability of `debug.sethook()` by using our enhanced `track_line` function for all line tracking, ensuring consistent data recording.

### 4. Coverage Module Integration

Added new public API functions in `lib/coverage/init.lua`:

```lua
-- Check execution status
function M.was_line_executed(file_path, line_num)

-- Check coverage status  
function M.was_line_covered(file_path, line_num)

-- Mark current line as covered (for assertions)
function M.mark_current_line_covered(level)
```

These functions provide a clear interface for users to check execution and coverage status and to mark lines as covered during test assertions.

### 5. Data Structure Separation

Ensured clear separation between execution and coverage data structures:

```lua
local coverage_data = {
  files = {},                   -- File metadata and content
  lines = {},                   -- Legacy structure for backward compatibility
  executed_lines = {},          -- All lines that were executed (raw execution)
  covered_lines = {},           -- Lines that are both executed and covered
  -- Additional structures for functions, blocks, conditions
}
```

This separation ensures that execution and coverage tracking are distinctly managed while maintaining backward compatibility.

### 6. Comprehensive Testing

Created two new test files:
- `tests/coverage/execution_vs_coverage_test.lua`: Tests the distinction between execution and coverage
- `tests/coverage/debug_hook_test.lua`: Tests the enhanced debug hook functionality

These tests verify that the system properly:
1. Tracks lines that are executed but not validated
2. Tracks lines that are both executed and validated
3. Correctly handles marking lines as covered through assertions

## Challenges Addressed

1. **Debug Hook Unreliability**: Solved by creating a more robust tracking method that doesn't solely rely on `debug.sethook()`.

2. **Execution vs. Coverage Distinction**: Implemented a clear conceptual and implementation distinction between executed code and covered (validated) code.

3. **Data Structure Inconsistency**: Created consistent data structures and API methods for tracking both execution and coverage.

4. **Source Code Metadata**: Enhanced handling of source code metadata to ensure consistent access for reports.

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Coverage Visualization**: The HTML formatter can now accurately display the four distinct states (non-executable, uncovered, executed-not-covered, covered).

2. **Better Test Quality Metrics**: Users can now identify code that runs during tests but isn't validated by assertions.

3. **Reliable Data Collection**: The enhanced tracking is significantly more reliable and provides consistent data.

4. **Clear API**: The new public APIs make it easy for test frameworks to integrate with the coverage module.

## Next Steps

1. **Integration with Assertion Framework**: The `mark_current_line_covered` function should be integrated into the assertion framework (`expect()`) to automatically mark lines that contain assertions.

2. **Enhanced Reporting**: Update reporting formats to clearly visualize the distinction between execution and coverage.

3. **Performance Optimization**: The current implementation prioritizes correctness over performance; future optimizations could improve efficiency.

4. **User Documentation**: Create documentation explaining the distinction between execution and coverage and how to use this feature effectively.
