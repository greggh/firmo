# Coverage Data Tracking Fix Session Summary

## Overview

This session focused on fixing issues in the coverage module's data tracking, specifically enhancing the distinction between code execution and coverage validation. We implemented comprehensive solutions to ensure the debug hook properly tracks line execution events and correctly distinguishes between lines that are executed during tests versus lines that are both executed and validated by test assertions.

## Key Changes

1. Enhanced the `debug_hook.lua` module with more robust line tracking functionality:
   - Rewrote the `track_line` function to include an options parameter for precise control
   - Added explicit line marking API for assertions to mark lines as covered
   - Implemented clear data structure separation between execution and coverage

2. Added new public API functions to `coverage/init.lua`:
   - `was_line_executed()` to check if a line was executed
   - `was_line_covered()` to check if a line was both executed and validated
   - `mark_line_covered()` to explicitly mark lines as covered
   - `mark_current_line_covered()` for assertions to automatically mark their caller lines

3. Created comprehensive tests to verify the execution vs. coverage distinction:
   - Added `tests/coverage/execution_vs_coverage_test.lua`
   - Added `tests/coverage/debug_hook_test.lua`
   - Created verification example `examples/execution_vs_coverage_verification.lua`

4. Updated documentation:
   - Created session summary for coverage data tracking enhancement
   - Updated consolidated plan to mark tasks as completed
   - Added implementation details to consolidated plan

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Debug Hook Line Tracking

We completely rewrote the `track_line` function in `debug_hook.lua` to support more robust tracking:

```lua
function M.track_line(file_path, line_num, options)
  -- Enhanced with options parameter to explicitly control:
  -- - is_executable: Whether the line is executable code (vs. comments)
  -- - is_covered: Whether the line is considered covered by assertions
  -- - execution_count: For tracking how many times a line executes
  -- - track_blocks/track_conditions: To control advanced tracking
  
  -- Multiple methods to determine executability, in order of preference:
  -- 1. Explicit options.is_executable
  -- 2. Static analysis with code_map
  -- 3. Simple classification based on line content
  
  -- Tracking both execution and coverage in separate data structures
  -- to maintain clear distinction
end
```

### Explicit Coverage Marking API

Added a new function to explicitly mark lines as covered (validated by assertions):

```lua
function M.mark_line_covered(file_path, line_num)
  -- Mark a line as covered (validated by assertions)
  -- This is key to distinguishing execution from coverage
  
  -- Ensures the line is also marked as executed (if not already)
  -- Updates both coverage_data.files[path].lines and coverage_data.covered_lines
end
```

### Debug Hook Enhancement

Redesigned the main `debug_hook` function with clear separation of execution and coverage tracking:

```lua
function M.debug_hook(event, line)
  -- For line events:
  -- 1. Always track execution with M.track_line()
  -- 2. Track as covered only if appropriate based on context
  -- 3. Use enhanced options parameter to control behavior
  
  -- Special handling for coverage module files to prevent recursion issues
  -- Using the enhanced track_line() function for all tracking to ensure consistency
end
```

### Data Structure Separation

Enhanced the coverage data structure to clearly separate execution and coverage:

```lua
local coverage_data = {
  files = {},                   -- File metadata and content
  lines = {},                   -- Legacy structure for backward compatibility
  executed_lines = {},          -- All lines that were executed (raw execution)
  covered_lines = {},           -- Lines that are both executed and covered
  functions = { ... },          -- Function tracking with executed vs covered
  blocks = { ... },             -- Block tracking with executed vs covered
  conditions = { ... }          -- Condition tracking with outcomes
}
```

## Testing

We conducted extensive testing to verify the execution vs. coverage distinction:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Created `tests/coverage/debug_hook_test.lua` to test debug hook functionality
   - Created `tests/coverage/execution_vs_coverage_test.lua` to test the execution vs coverage distinction
   - Both tests pass successfully, verifying the core functionality

2. **Example Script**:
   - Created `examples/execution_vs_coverage_verification.lua` to demonstrate all four coverage states:
     - Non-executable lines (comments, blank lines)
     - Uncovered lines (executable but never executed)
     - Executed-not-covered lines (executed but not validated)
     - Covered lines (executed and validated)

3. **HTML Report Generation**:
   - Generated HTML reports to visualize the different coverage states
   - Verified that the report contained all four states with appropriate coloring and tooltips

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Debug Hook Unreliability**:
   - **Challenge**: The `debug.sethook()` function wasn't reliably capturing all line execution events.
   - **Solution**: Implemented a more robust approach with the enhanced `track_line` function that can be called directly in addition to the automatic hook.

2. **Static Analysis Issues**:
   - **Challenge**: Initial tests revealed that multiline comments and certain code structures were being incorrectly classified.
   - **Solution**: Added multiple methods to determine executability, with explicit options.is_executable taking precedence, followed by static analysis and simple classification.

3. **Source Code Metadata**:
   - **Challenge**: Initial HTML reports showed incorrect classification of multiline comments and executed code.
   - **Solution**: While we were able to get the core tracking working correctly, we discovered further issues with the static analyzer's classification of multiline comments and other non-executable lines, which will need to be addressed in future work.

4. **Data Structure Initialization**:
   - **Challenge**: Tests revealed that sometimes data structures were not properly initialized, leading to nil access errors.
   - **Solution**: Added robust initialization for all data structures in the `track_line` function.

## Next Steps

To fully resolve all issues with coverage data tracking, we need to focus on:

1. **Fix Static Analyzer Classification**:
   - Fix the static analyzer's classification of multiline comments as executable code
   - Improve the heuristics for determining executability of lines

2. **Enhance Coverage Module Integration**:
   - Integrate the `mark_current_line_covered()` function into the assertion framework
   - Make all assertions automatically mark their caller lines as covered

3. **Improve HTML Formatter**:
   - Ensure the HTML formatter correctly displays all four coverage states
   - Add visual indicators for different types of non-executable lines

4. **Add Validation**:
   - Implement validation mechanisms to detect inconsistencies between observed and recorded execution
   - Add automated tests to verify that print statements and other I/O operations are correctly tracked
