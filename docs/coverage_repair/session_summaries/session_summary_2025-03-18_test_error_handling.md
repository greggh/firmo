# Session Summary: Improved Test Error Handling

## Date: 2025-03-18

## Overview

This session focused on addressing issues with error handling during test execution. Specifically, we worked on distinguishing between intentional test assertion failures and actual unexpected errors. Initially, we implemented a solution that suppressed all error output during tests, but recognized this approach was overly broad and would mask legitimate errors. We laid the groundwork for a more targeted approach to handling test errors.

## Key Changes

1. **Error Handler Improvements**:
   - Added a `TEST_EXPECTED` error category for errors that are part of test assertions
   - Implemented `test_expected_error()` function for structured test errors
   - Added `is_expected_test_error()` helper function
   - Added metatable to error objects for better string conversion
   - Created functions to properly set and query test mode
   - Added `is_suppressing_test_logs()` function

2. **Test Mode Detection**:
   - Removed unreliable pattern-based test detection approach (using `source:match("test")`)
   - Implemented explicit test mode setting via test runner
   - Added integration with central_config for consistent test mode state

3. **Integration with Mocking System**:
   - Updated mock verification to handle test errors properly
   - Fixed spy error handling to better detect test environments
   - Modified stub implementation to use structured test errors

## Implementation Details

### Error Handler Module Changes

We made significant improvements to the error_handler module:

```lua
-- Added new error category for expected test errors
M.CATEGORY = {
  -- existing categories...
  TEST_EXPECTED = "TEST_EXPECTED", -- Errors that are expected during tests
}

-- Added metatable for better string conversion
local mt = {
  __tostring = function(err)
    if type(err) == "table" and err.message then
      return err.message
    else
      return tostring(err)
    end
  end
}

-- Function to create test-specific errors
function M.test_expected_error(message, context, cause)
  return create_error(message, M.CATEGORY.TEST_EXPECTED, M.SEVERITY.ERROR, context, cause)
end
```

### Mocking System Integration

We improved the mocking system's error handling:

```lua
-- Properly detect test mode
local is_test_mode = error_handler and 
                     type(error_handler) == "table" and 
                     type(error_handler.is_test_mode) == "function" and
                     error_handler.is_test_mode()

-- Check if this appears to be a test-related error 
local is_expected_in_test = is_test_mode and 
                            error_during_execution and 
                            type(error_during_execution) == "table" and 
                            (error_during_execution.category == "VALIDATION" or
                             error_during_execution.category == "TEST_EXPECTED")
```

## Testing

We tested our changes with:

1. **Mock System Tests**: 
   - Ran the mocking_test.lua file to verify that our changes properly handle errors
   - Tested various error scenarios including verification failures and intentional errors

2. **Core Framework Tests**:
   - Ran the core test suite to ensure the framework still operates correctly
   - Verified that legitimate errors are still displayed

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Overly Broad Error Suppression**:
   - **Challenge**: Our initial implementation suppressed all errors during tests, hiding legitimate issues
   - **Solution**: We recognized the need for a more targeted approach that would only suppress errors for tests intentionally testing error conditions

2. **Circular Dependencies**:
   - **Challenge**: Attempts to directly configure logging from error_handler caused circular dependency issues
   - **Solution**: Used a more isolated approach where each module handles its own error suppression based on global test mode state

3. **String Pattern Matching**:
   - **Challenge**: Previous implementation used unreliable string pattern matching to identify tests
   - **Solution**: Removed all string pattern matching in favor of explicit test mode state and structured error properties

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Test-Level Error Suppression**:
   - Create a system for marking specific tests as intentionally testing error conditions
   - Add metadata to tests (e.g., `it("should fail when...", { expect_error = true }, function()...`)
   - Only suppress errors originating from tests with the expect_error flag

2. **Error Context Propagation**:
   - Implement a mechanism to track error context through the call stack
   - Ensure errors can be linked back to their originating test 
   - Allow for more targeted error handling based on origin

3. **Improve Test Runner Integration**:
   - Update the test runner to better distinguish between expected and unexpected errors
   - Create clearer reporting for different error types
   - Add summary reports that separate expected failures from unexpected ones

4. **More Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Create dedicated tests for the error handling system itself
   - Verify that both expected and unexpected errors are handled correctly
   - Test error propagation across module boundaries
