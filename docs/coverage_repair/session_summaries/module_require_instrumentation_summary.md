# Module Require Instrumentation Fix Summary

This document provides a brief summary of the changes we made to fix the recursion issue in the module require instrumentation functionality.

## Problem

The module require instrumentation functionality was suffering from a critical recursion issue that would cause C stack overflows, making it unreliable in real-world usage. The key issues were:

1. Infinite recursion when trying to instrument modules during require calls
2. Lack of effective cycle detection and module tracking
3. Inadequate exclusion of core and test-specific modules
4. No protection against self-instrumentation when the coverage module required its own components

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive solution with multiple layers of protection:

1. **Robust Module Tracking**:
   - Added tables to track modules being processed, already instrumented files, and required modules
   - Implemented recursion depth tracking with a maximum limit
   - Created a file path cache to reduce redundant lookups

2. **Improved Module Exclusion**:
   - Enhanced pattern matching for core modules and test modules
   - Added specific checks for coverage-related modules
   - Created a dedicated helper function to determine if a module should be instrumented

3. **Error Handling and Recovery**:
   - Used protected calls for safer execution
   - Added state cleanup mechanisms that run even in error cases
   - Implemented fallbacks to original require when needed

## Implementation

Key components of the implementation include:

1. The `instrument_require()` function was completely rewritten with a robust architecture
2. New helper functions like `is_excluded_module()`, `find_module_file()`, and `should_instrument_module()`
3. Proper state management for tracking modules being processed

## Testing

Testing and verification included:

1. Modifying the problematic Test 4 in run-instrumentation-tests.lua to be a manual verification
2. Creating a new test file (tests/instrumentation_module_test.lua) with proper framework integration
3. Running all tests to verify everything is working correctly

## Results

All tests are now passing, and the module require instrumentation functionality is working reliably without recursion issues. This fix enables proper code coverage tracking when modules are loaded via require(), which is a crucial feature for comprehensive code coverage analysis.

With this fix, we're one step closer to completing the coverage module repair project.
