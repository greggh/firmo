# Session Summary: Assertion Module Extraction

## Date: 2025-03-15

## Summary

In this session, we implemented the standalone assertion module as described in the assertion extraction plan. The primary goals were to resolve circular dependencies, implement consistent error handling, and prepare for improved error reporting in assertions.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Created standalone assertion module** (`lib/assertion.lua`)
   - Extracted core assertion functionality from firmo.lua
   - Implemented expect() function with proper error handling
   - Extracted utility functions like eq() and isa()
   - Implemented all assertion paths from the original implementation
   - Added proper structured error handling using error_handler
   - Used lazy-loading for dependencies to avoid circular references

2. **Created comprehensive tests** (`tests/assertions/assertion_module_test.lua`)
   - Basic functionality tests for the module interface
   - Tests for expect() function and assertion chaining
   - Tests for basic assertions (equal, type, truthy, exist)
   - Tests for advanced assertions (match, contain, comparison)
   - Tests for error handling scenarios
   - Tests for negation support with to_not
   - Tests for table comparison with diffs

3. **Added integration tests** (`tests/assertions/assertion_module_integration_test.lua`)
   - Tests to verify that the new module behaves identically to firmo.expect
   - Comparison of error handling behaviors
   - Verification of API compatibility

4. **Implemented Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Used structured error objects for assertion failures
   - Included context information (expected values, actual values)
   - Added detailed error messages for better debugging
   - Implemented proper error propagation
   - Added logging for assertion failures and successes

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

The implementation follows these key principles:

1. **Lazy Loading of Dependencies**
   - Used lazy loading for error_handler and logging to avoid circular dependencies
   - Created local cached variables for modules to avoid repeated requires

2. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Preserved the same assertion chaining API (e.g., expect(value).to.equal(expected))
   - Maintained all existing assertion paths and functions
   - Ensured consistent behavior with the original implementation

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Used error_handler.try() for structured error handling
   - Created proper error context objects with expected/actual values
   - Added value stringification for better error messages
   - Implemented detailed diff generation for table comparisons

4. **Extensibility**
   - Exposed paths table to allow extensions
   - Made utility functions like eq() and isa() publicly available
   - Structured code to enable future expansion

### Module Structure

The `assertion.lua` module exports:

- `expect()`: Main assertion function
- `eq()`: Deep equality check
- `isa()`: Type checking function
- `paths`: Table of assertion paths for extension

### Implementation Challenges

1. **Varargs Handling**: Fixed issues with varargs handling by using table unpacking 
2. **Lua Version Compatibility**: Ensured compatibility with both Lua 5.1 and 5.2+ by using a compatibility layer for unpack
3. **Error Propagation**: Implemented proper error propagation with context information
4. **Table Comparison**: Enhanced table comparison with detailed diffs

## Test Results

All tests pass successfully, confirming that:

1. The module provides the same functionality as the original firmo
2. Error handling is consistent and provides useful context
3. The API is backward compatible with existing tests
4. All assertion types are correctly implemented

## Next Steps

1. **Integration with firmo.lua**
   - Update firmo.lua to use the new assertion module
   - Implement backward compatibility layer
   - Remove duplicated code from firmo.lua

2. **Testing in Existing Test Suite**
   - Run existing tests to ensure compatibility
   - Fix any issues that arise

3. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation to reflect the new module
   - Create migration guide for extension developers

## Observations

The new assertion module successfully addresses the main issues identified in the plan:

1. **Circular Dependencies**: By extracting the assertion functionality into a separate module and using lazy loading, we've broken the circular dependency chain.

2. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: We've implemented consistent error handling using structured error objects throughout the module.

3. **Complex Error Propagation**: The module now properly propagates errors with context information, making debugging easier.

The implementation is fully backward compatible with existing tests while providing a foundation for improved error reporting and future enhancements.
