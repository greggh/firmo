# Example and Documentation Update Session Summary - 2025-03-11

## Overview

This session focused on updating examples and documentation to align with the best practices established during the test update phase. We've identified and fixed issues in several key example files and updated the documentation to ensure consistency across the entire project.

## Work Completed

### Example Files Updated:

1. **basic_example.lua**:
   - Fixed before/after hook imports by adding `local before, after = firmo.before, firmo.after`
   - Replaced print statements with structured logging using firmo.log.info
   - Added comment clarifying that tests are run by scripts/runner.lua or run_all_tests.lua
   - Enhanced example readability while preserving the teaching purpose
   - Successfully validated that the updated example works

2. **assertions_example.lua**:
   - Removed unnecessary package.path modification
   - Replaced print statement at the end with proper comment
   - Maintained the comprehensive assertions demonstrations
   - Successfully validated that the example runs correctly

3. **watch_mode_example.lua**:
   - Removed hardcoded paths and unnecessary path manipulation
   - Simplified module loading
   - Replaced all print statements with structured logging using firmo.log.info
   - Added proper comment about test execution
   - Successfully validated the example works as expected

### Documentation Updated:

1. **getting-started.md**:
   - Updated test running instructions to use scripts/runner.lua instead of direct file execution
   - Added note clarifying that tests are run by runner scripts, not by direct execution
   - Enhanced Before/After hook section to show proper hook imports
   - Added structured logging examples in the hooks section
   - Updated the "Running Tests" section with correct commands for:
     - Running a single test file
     - Running multiple test files
     - Filtering tests by tags or patterns
     - Using watch mode for continuous testing
   - Maintained the educational value while ensuring best practices

## Findings and Observations

1. **Common Issues in Examples**:
   - Many examples used direct print statements instead of structured logging
   - Several examples modified package.path directly
   - Some examples contained hardcoded absolute paths
   - Most examples didn't explicitly import hooks (before/after)
   - Documentation sometimes showed direct file execution rather than using runner scripts

2. **Importance of Consistent Examples**:
   - Examples serve as models for users to follow
   - Inconsistency between examples and actual best practices can lead to confusion
   - Documentation and examples should match the standards enforced in the codebase itself
   - Maintaining the same patterns across examples provides a unified learning experience

3. **Balancing Simplicity and Best Practices**:
   - Examples need to be simple enough to understand
   - Yet robust enough to demonstrate good practices
   - We achieved this balance by:
     - Keeping core functionality intact
     - Adding brief comments explaining proper usage
     - Using clean, consistent patterns across examples
     - Preserving educational value while updating implementation details

## Benefits of Updates

1. **Consistency Across Project**:
   - All tests, examples, and documentation now follow the same best practices
   - Users will learn correct patterns from the beginning
   - Less confusion about proper test structure and execution

2. **Better Learning Resources**:
   - Updated examples demonstrate not just what to test, but how to test properly
   - Documentation now shows correct hook usage and import patterns
   - Added structured logging examples provide templates for proper debug information

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   - Removed hardcoded paths and direct path concatenation
   - Updated documentation to use cross-platform patterns
   - Examples will work correctly regardless of operating system

## Conclusion

By updating key examples and documentation, we've ensured that the entire project consistently follows our established best practices. This completes our comprehensive testing framework standardization effort, providing a solid foundation for both the continued development of the coverage module and for users learning from our examples and documentation.

This work rounds out the test update phase by ensuring that all aspects of the testing framework—from test files to examples to documentation—are aligned and following the same established patterns. Now we can proceed with confidence to the next phases of the coverage module repair plan, knowing that the testing foundation is solid and consistent.
