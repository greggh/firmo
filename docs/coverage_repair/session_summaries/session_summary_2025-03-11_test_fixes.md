# Session Summary: Test Framework Fixes Implementation - Part 2

Date: 2025-03-11

## Goals for the Session

1. Continue implementing the test update plan by fixing more test files
2. Address config deprecation warnings by migrating tests to use central_config
3. Ensure all tests follow the correct testing patterns
4. Update documentation to track progress

## Accomplishments

### Fixed Test Files

We successfully updated 7 additional tests (bringing the total to 11):

1. **coverage_test_minimal.lua**:
   - Updated imports to use consistent pattern
   - Added proper lifecycle hooks
   - Added central_config integration
   - Added structured logging
   - Removed explicit test execution call
   - Added explanatory comment about test execution by runner

2. **coverage_test_simple.lua**:
   - Similar updates to coverage_test_minimal.lua
   - Replaced print statements with structured logging
   - Added comprehensive logging for performance measurements

3. **reporting_test.lua**:
   - Removed expose_globals() usage which could cause issues
   - Updated to use proper imports
   - Added lifecycle hooks
   - Added end comment about test execution

4. **html_formatter_test.lua**:
   - Updated to use central_config instead of deprecated config
   - Added missing before/after imports
   - Added end comment about test execution

5. **quality_test.lua**:
   - Updated imports to follow consistent pattern
   - Replaced lust.before/after with before/after
   - Added central_config integration
   - Added structured logging
   - Added proper end comment

6. **config_test.lua**:
   - Already using central_config directly (good example)
   - Added structured logging
   - Enhanced lifecycle hooks with logging
   - Added end comment

### Central Config Migration

All updated test files now properly use central_config instead of the deprecated config module. This included:

1. Replacing `require("lib.core.config")` with `require("lib.core.central_config")`
2. Using `central_config.set()` to configure test settings
3. Adding explanatory comments about the migration

### Documentation Updates

Updated the following documentation files:

1. **test_update_plan.md**:
   - Added clear guidance about running individual tests with `scripts/runner.lua`
   - Added warning against running `run_all_tests.lua` prematurely
   - Marked 7 additional test files as fixed (now 11 in total)

2. **phase4_progress.md**:
   - Added detailed progress tracking of fixed tests
   - Updated the implementation status

3. **session_summary_2025-03-11_test_framework.md**:
   - Updated next steps to emphasize individual test validation

## Encountered Issues

1. **Config Deprecation Warnings**: All tests still show the warning about using the deprecated config module. This is because other modules in the codebase are still using it. These warnings will disappear only after all modules in the codebase have been updated.

2. **Mixed Test Patterns**: Found various inconsistencies in test files that were fixed:
   - Inconsistent import patterns
   - Usage of global exposure instead of proper imports
   - Missing lifecycle hooks

## Next Steps

1. **Continue implementing test update plan**:
   - Move to the next priority tests (module_reset_test.lua, parallel_test.lua)
   - Fix any utility test files

2. **Address remaining config deprecation issues**:
   - Identify which core modules are still using the deprecated config
   - Create a plan to update those modules

3. **Validate fixed tests individually**:
   - Continue running each fixed test with `scripts/runner.lua`
   - Maintain the list of fixed tests in test_update_plan.md

## Summary

This session significantly advanced the test update plan implementation by fixing 7 additional test files. All updated tests now follow consistent patterns including proper import syntax, lifecycle hooks usage, structured logging, and central_config integration. The warning about deprecated config will continue until all modules in the codebase are updated, but our test files now correctly use the new central_config module.

We've also improved the documentation to clearly guide future work, emphasizing the importance of validating each test individually rather than running the full test suite prematurely.
