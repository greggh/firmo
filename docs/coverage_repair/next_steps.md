# Next Steps for Error Handling Implementation

## Completed Critical Issues

1. ✅ **Fixed Coverage Module Error Handling**:
   - Removed all fallback code in coverage/init.lua that assumes error_handler might not be available
   - Replaced all blocks with pattern `if error_handler then ... else ...` with direct error_handler calls
   - Ensured consistent error handling patterns throughout the module
   - Fixed all error propagation paths to properly return errors up the call stack

2. ✅ **Fixed Test Suite**:
   - Updated coverage_error_handling_test.lua to remove all skipped tests
   - Fixed the tests that used `expect(true).to.equal(true)` to address the underlying issues
   - Fixed global reference issues in tests
   - Ran tests through runner.lua using the provided script

3. ✅ **Documented Standard Error Handling Patterns**:
   - Updated error_handling_guide.md
   - Created session_summaries/session_summary_2025-03-11_error_handling_implementation.md with examples

   - Confirmed no conditional error handler checks are present
   - Created session_summaries/session_summary_2025-03-11_instrumentation_error_handling_verification.md

### 2. Reporting Module

1. **Implement error handling in reporting/init.lua**:
   - Apply consistent error handling patterns
   - Ensure proper error propagation
   - Create/update tests to verify error handling

2. **Add error handling to all formatters**:
   - Apply consistent error handling patterns
   - Ensure proper error propagation
   - Create/update tests to verify error handling

### 3. Documentation

1. **Create detailed error handling documentation**:
   - Document error categories and severity levels
   - Provide examples of proper error handling
   - Create guidelines for error propagation

2. **Develop guidelines for effective error handling and recovery**:
   - When to use each error category
   - How to handle different types of errors
   - Best practices for error recovery

## Project-Wide Error Handling Focus

The error handling implementation strategy has been expanded to cover the entire lust-next project, not just the coverage module. This represents a fundamental architectural improvement that will enhance reliability, maintainability, and user experience across the entire codebase.

### New Documentation

- ✅ Created project_wide_error_handling_plan.md with comprehensive approach for all modules
- ✅ Completed comprehensive rewrite of coverage/init.lua with proper error handling
- ✅ Fixed syntax error at line 1129 and verified with instrumentation tests
- ⚙️ Will update all existing error handling documentation to reflect project-wide focus

### Action Items for Next Session

1. Fix remaining issues identified with coverage/init.lua (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
   - [✅] Fix error in static_analyzer during file patching process (attempt to index a boolean value) (Completed 2025-03-11)
   - [✅] Investigate and fix instrumentation test failures (Completed 2025-03-11)

2. Implement comprehensive error handling in core modules (HIGH PRIORITY):
   - ✅ central_config.lua (Completed 2025-03-11)
   - [⚙️] module_reset.lua (Partially implemented 2025-03-11, issues identified with lust_next.reset function)
   - [ ] filesystem.lua
   - [ ] version.lua
   - [ ] main lust-next.lua

3. Create comprehensive tests for coverage/init.lua:
   - [ ] Create dedicated test suite for all error conditions
   - [ ] Test edge cases and recovery mechanisms
   - [ ] Verify error propagation across module boundaries

4. Begin implementing error handling in reporting modules:
   - [ ] reporting/init.lua
   - [ ] Start with critical formatters (html, json, junit)

5. Create project-wide error handling test suite:
   - [ ] Create tests that verify error propagation across module boundaries
   - [ ] Test recovery mechanisms in real-world scenarios
   - [ ] Validate error handling consistency across the project

6. Fix any remaining instrumentation issues:
   - [ ] Update instrumentation.lua to directly add _ENV preservation in generated code
   - [ ] Add comprehensive tests for instrumentation edge cases
   - [ ] Create examples demonstrating instrumentation usage
