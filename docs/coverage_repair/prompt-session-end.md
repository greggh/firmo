# Coverage Repair Session End Prompt

Claude, we're ending today's session on the lust-next coverage module repair project. Before we wrap up, I need you to ensure all documentation is properly updated.

## PRE-AUTHORIZATION REMINDER

Remember that you are pre-authorized to:
1. Read any files in the lust-next project WITHOUT asking permission
2. Use the LS command to explore directories WITHOUT asking permission
3. Update documentation files in the docs/coverage_repair directory WITHOUT asking permission
4. View, analyze, and understand code in any lust-next files WITHOUT asking permission

This means you should DIRECTLY make any necessary documentation updates without asking me first.

## Documentation Update Checklist

Please verify and confirm that you've updated the following documents based on today's progress:

1. **Phase Progress File**:
   - Have you marked all completed tasks with âœ“?
   - Have you added a summary of today's work and findings?
   - Have you recorded any blockers or issues discovered?

2. **Architecture Documentation**:
   - Have you updated architecture_overview.md with any new architectural decisions?
   - Have you updated component_responsibilities.md with any responsibility changes?
   - Have you updated interfaces.md with any interface modifications?

3. **Code Audit Documentation**:
   - Have you updated code_audit_results.md with any audit findings addressed?
   - Have you updated debug_code_inventory.md with any debug code removed?

4. **Test Documentation**:
   - Have you updated test_plan.md with any new test plans?
   - Have you added entries to test_results.md for any tests run today?
   - Have you verified that tests address root causes rather than implementing workarounds?
   - Have you confirmed that the testing methodology follows the guidelines in testing_guide.md?
   - Have you checked that tests are using the correct lust-next functions?
   - Have you verified that tests do not contain explicit calls to `lust()` or `lust.run()`?
   - Have you confirmed that tests use `before`/`after` instead of `before_all`/`after_all`?

If any of these documents need updates, please make those updates NOW before responding further.

5. **Session Summary**:
   - Have you created a session summary in the `/docs/coverage_repair/session_summaries/` directory?
   - Have you named it as `session_summary_2025-03-11_topic.md` using today's date?
   - Have you included all issues addressed, solutions implemented, and next steps?
   - Have you referenced this session summary in other documentation as needed?

Once all documentation is updated, please provide:

1. A brief summary of what we accomplished today
2. A list of any incomplete tasks that need attention in the next session
3. Confirmation that all documentation has been updated
4. The path to the session summary file you created

This documentation maintenance is critical for the project's success. Thank you!
