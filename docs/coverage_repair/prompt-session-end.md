## Session Summary Task

1. Create a session summary file in the `/docs/coverage_repair/session_summaries/` directory with the name `session_summary_YYYY-MM-DD_topic.md`, where:
   - Use today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format
   - Replace 'topic' with a brief description of what we worked on (e.g., assertion_extraction, error_handling_rewrite)

2. Include the following sections in your session summary:
   - **Overview**: Brief description of what was accomplished
   - **Key Changes**: List of significant changes made
   - **Implementation Details**: Technical details of the implementation
   - **Testing**: Summary of tests performed
   - **Challenges and Solutions**: Any challenges encountered and how they were addressed
   - **Next Steps**: What should be done in the next session

3. Update the consolidated_plan.md with:
   - Checkmarks (âœ“) for completed tasks
   - Notes on implementation details
