# Quality Module Integration

This document outlines the integration between the coverage module and the quality validation module, leveraging shared components for enhanced code quality analysis.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define how the revitalized coverage module will integrate with the quality module, sharing components like the parser and static analyzer to provide comprehensive code quality metrics alongside coverage data.

## Integration Points

1. **Shared Static Analysis**: How the same AST and static analysis will serve both coverage and quality needs
2. **Test-to-Code Mapping**: How coverage data will enhance quality analysis
3. **Combined Reporting**: How coverage and quality metrics will be presented together
4. **Configuration Integration**: How settings will be coordinated between modules

## Documentation Status

This document is currently in its initial state and will be expanded with detailed integration specifications as part of Phase 4 of the coverage module repair plan.
