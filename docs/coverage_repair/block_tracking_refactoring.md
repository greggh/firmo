# Block Tracking Refactoring

## Overview

This document describes the refactoring of block tracking responsibility in the coverage module.

## Problem Statement

The responsibility for tracking code blocks was split between two components:

1. **init.lua**: Contained block tracking logic in the track_execution function
2. **debug_hook.lua**: Had its own implementation in the debug_hook function

This duplication created several issues:
- Potential inconsistencies in how blocks were tracked between components
- Maintenance burden when fixing bugs or enhancing block tracking
- Violation of the Single Responsibility Principle
- Difficulty in understanding and debugging the block tracking logic

## Solution Approach

The solution was to consolidate all block tracking responsibility into the debug_hook.lua component and provide a public API for other components to use. This enforces a clear separation of concerns:

- **debug_hook.lua**: Responsible for all block tracking logic through a centralized API
- **init.lua**: Uses the debug_hook API for block tracking without duplicating logic

## Implementation Details

### Changes to debug_hook.lua

1. Created a new public M.track_blocks_for_line function that provides a centralized implementation for block tracking
2. Made the function handle all error cases and edge conditions
3. Added proper logging for debugging purposes
4. Ensured the function maintains parent-child block relationships
5. Updated the debug_hook implementation to use this new function

### Changes to init.lua

1. Replaced the duplicated block tracking code with a call to debug_hook.track_blocks_for_line
2. Added logging to show when blocks are tracked through the centralized API
3. Removed 30+ lines of duplicated logic, making the code easier to maintain

### Documentation Updates

1. Updated interfaces.md to document the new track_blocks_for_line function
2. Updated component_responsibilities.md to reflect the consolidated responsibility
3. Updated phase1_progress.md to mark block tracking isolation as complete
4. Added this document to provide detailed information about the refactoring

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All block tracking logic is now in one place
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to block tracking only need to be made in debug_hook.lua
3. **Clearer Responsibilities**: Each component has well-defined responsibilities
4. **Better Interface**: The interface between components is now cleaner and more explicit
5. **Future Extensibility**: Easier to enhance block tracking in the future

## Next Steps

With block tracking properly isolated to the debug_hook component, we can now move on to addressing the last remaining area of responsibility overlap:

1. Multiline Comments (patchup vs coverage init)

This final improvement will complete the Component Isolation task and prepare us to move to Phase 2: Core Functionality Fixes.
