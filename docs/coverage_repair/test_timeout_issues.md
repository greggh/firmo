# Coverage Module Test Timeout Issues

## Overview

This document tracks test files in the coverage module that are experiencing timeout issues. These tests need optimization to improve their performance and reliability.

## Tests with Timeout Issues

1. `/home/gregg/Projects/lua-library/firmo/tests/coverage/fallback_heuristic_analysis_test.lua`
   - **Possible Causes**: 
     - Complex coverage operations with static analysis disabled
     - Issues with the fallback heuristic analysis mechanism
     - File tracking with large test files

2. `/home/gregg/Projects/lua-library/firmo/tests/coverage/static_analyzer/condition_expression_test.lua`
   - **Possible Causes**:
     - Complex code analysis with nested conditions
     - Performance bottlenecks in condition expression tracking
     - Parser limitations with complex expressions

## Recommended Solutions

### Short-term Solutions

1. **Test Timeout Handling**:
   - Add explicit timeout handling to tests
   - Split complex tests into smaller units
   - Add conditional logic to skip or simplify tests that consistently timeout

2. **Logging Reduction**:
   - Reduce debug logging in these tests
   - Implement conditional logging only when needed

### Medium-term Solutions

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Identify bottlenecks in fallback heuristic analysis
   - Optimize static analyzer's condition expression handling
   - Cache intermediate results where possible

2. **Test Simplification**:
   - Refactor tests to reduce complexity
   - Create separate slow/fast test suites
   - Add progress reporting for long-running tests

### Long-term Solutions

1. **Architecture Improvements**:
   - Redesign fallback heuristic analysis for better performance
   - Implement incremental static analysis
   - Add better timeout detection and recovery mechanisms

## Next Steps

1. Profile test execution to identify specific bottlenecks
2. Implement the short-term solutions first to improve test reliability
3. Plan for medium-term optimizations in subsequent development cycles
