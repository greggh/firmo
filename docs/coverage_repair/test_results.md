# Report Validation Implementation Test Results

## Overview

This document contains the test results for the report validation implementation. The implementation adds schema validation, format validation, and comprehensive validation capabilities to the lust-next reporting system.

## Schema Validation Tests

The schema validation tests verify that the schema definitions and validation logic work as expected.

```
Schema Validation
	Schema definitions
		✓ should provide schema for coverage data
		✓ should provide schema for test results data
		✓ should provide schemas for various report formats
	Schema validation
		✓ should validate valid coverage data
		✓ should detect invalid coverage data
		✓ should validate valid test results data
		✓ should detect invalid test results data
	Format validation
		✓ should validate valid HTML output
		✓ should detect invalid HTML output
		✓ should validate valid JSON output
		✓ should detect invalid JSON output
		✓ should validate valid LCOV output
		✓ should detect invalid LCOV output
	Auto-detection
		✓ should detect schema for coverage data
		✓ should detect schema for test results data
		✓ should detect schema for HTML output
		✓ should detect schema for LCOV output
	Integration with reporting module
		✓ should provide format validation function
		✓ should validate formats through reporting module
		✓ should detect invalid formats through reporting module
		✓ should include format validation in comprehensive report validation
```

All tests have passed, confirming that:
- Schema definitions are properly defined
- Validation logic correctly validates and invalidates data
- Format-specific validation works for all supported formats
- Auto-detection correctly identifies data and report types
- Integration with the reporting module is working correctly

## Example Results

The `report_validation_example.lua` example demonstrates the validation system in action. It shows:

1. **Basic Data Validation**:
   ```
   Coverage data validation: PASSED
   ```

2. **Format Validation**:
   ```
   html format validation: PASSED
   json format validation: FAILED - Format validation failed: : Expected type table, got string
   lcov format validation: FAILED - Format validation failed: String content does not match required pattern
   cobertura format validation: PASSED
   ```

3. **Comprehensive Validation**:
   ```
   Data validation: PASSED
   Format validation: PASSED
   Cross-check with static analysis: 0 files checked
   ```

4. **Invalid Report Validation**:
   ```
   Invalid data validation: FAILED (expected)
   Issues found: 1
   Issue 1: Coverage data failed schema validation: summary: Missing required property: total_files (schema_validation)
   ```

5. **Saving Reports with Validation**:
   ```
   Saved report with default validation: SUCCESS
   Saved report with strict validation: FAILED (expected) - table: 0x5b730dab70e0
   Saved report with validation disabled: SUCCESS
   ```

These results confirm that the validation system:
- Correctly validates valid data
- Identifies and reports issues in invalid data
- Handles format validation for different report formats
- Can be configured to strictly enforce validation during save operations
- Provides detailed error information when validation fails

## Implementation Capabilities

The implementation provides the following capabilities:

1. **Schema Validation**:
   - JSON Schema-inspired validation for data structures
   - Type checking, required property validation, and value constraints
   - Support for nested properties and array validation
   - Detailed error messages with paths to the validation issues

2. **Format Validation**:
   - Validation for HTML, JSON, LCOV, Cobertura, TAP, JUnit, and CSV formats
   - Format-specific validation rules
   - Content pattern validation
   - Auto-detection of formats based on content

3. **Comprehensive Validation**:
   - Data structure validation
   - Format validation
   - Statistical analysis of coverage data
   - Cross-checking with static analysis
   - Anomaly detection
   - Detailed validation reports

4. **Validation Integration**:
   - Direct validation functions for testing and custom workflows
   - Automatic validation during report saving
   - Strict mode that prevents saving invalid reports
   - Configuration options to control validation behavior

## Conclusion

The report validation implementation successfully addresses the requirements for data integrity and format validation in the lust-next reporting system. The implementation is flexible, extensible, and well-integrated with the existing codebase. All tests have passed, and the example demonstrates the system working as expected.
