### Module Require Instrumentation Tests

Tests for the module require instrumentation functionality:

1. **run-instrumentation-tests.lua**:
   - Test 1 (Basic Line Instrumentation): ✅ PASS
   - Test 2 (Conditional Branch Instrumentation): ✅ PASS
   - Test 3 (Table Constructor Instrumentation): ✅ PASS
   - Test 4 (Module Require Instrumentation): ✅ PASS (manual verification)

2. **instrumentation_module_test.lua**:
   - "should successfully instrument and execute a required module": ✅ PASS
   - "should not re-instrument an already loaded module": ✅ PASS
