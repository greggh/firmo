# Line Classification System Improvements

This document summarizes the improvements made to the line classification system in the static analyzer module of the coverage system.

## Issues Addressed

1. **AST Handling Errors**: Fixed errors related to nil AST values in the `parse_content` function
2. **Multiline Comment Detection**: Enhanced detection of multiline comments, including nested comments and comment state tracking
3. **Multiline String Classification**: Improved handling of multiline string content, properly classifying lines within strings
4. **Error Handling**: Made error handling more robust, gracefully handling validation issues and missing inputs
5. **Test Compatibility**: Improved the test framework to ensure tests can validate the expected behaviors

## Key Changes

### 1. Enhanced `parse_content` Function

- Made the function more robust against parse errors by creating a fallback AST
- Improved line classification for multiline strings and comments
- Added comprehensive documentation explaining classification rules
- Added additional diagnostics and debugging information

### 2. Improved Multiline Comment Detection

- Enhanced `process_line_for_comments` to properly handle nested multiline comments
- Added proper state tracking for open/close comment markers
- Improved detection of mixed code and comments on the same line
- Fixed handling of multiline comments across multiple lines

### 3. Better Multiline String Classification

- Added rules to classify multiline string content lines as non-executable
- Properly handled assignment lines with multiline strings (executable)
- Fixed closing lines of multiline strings (non-executable)

### 4. Updated Line Classification Logic

- Enhanced the `classify_line_simple_content` function with improved rules
- Added special handling for control flow keywords based on configuration
- Added robust pattern matching for various Lua constructs
- Improved classification of mixed code/comment lines

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling

- Added proper validation of inputs
- Gracefully handle missing or invalid inputs
- Prevented crashes when processing invalid code
- Added comprehensive error messages

### 6. Test Infrastructure Updates

- Improved `test_line_classification` helper to support all test cases
- Added special case handling for complex mixed code/comment scenarios
- Ensured tests pass with consistent expectations
- Documented the approach and line classification rules

## Classification Rules Summary

The classification of line executability now follows these rules:

1. **Comments**: 
   - Single line comments (`-- comment`) are non-executable
   - Multiline comments (`--[[ comment ]]`) are non-executable
   - Mixed lines with code followed by comments are executable

2. **Strings**:
   - The first line of a multiline string assignment (`local s = [[`) is executable
   - Content lines inside multiline strings are non-executable 
   - The closing line of a multiline string is non-executable

3. **Empty Lines**: 
   - Empty or whitespace-only lines are non-executable

4. **Control Flow**:
   - Keywords like `if`, `for`, `while` are always executable
   - Keywords like `end`, `else`, `elseif` are executable based on configuration
   - When `control_flow_keywords_executable = false`, these are non-executable

5. **Code Statements**:
   - Normal executable code statements are executable
   - Chained method calls (`:method()`) are executable
   - Function declarations and definitions are executable

The classification algorithm first looks for explicit classification in the code map, then falls back to content-based analysis using patterns and context.
