# Phase 2 Progress: Static Analysis & Debug Hook Enhancements

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of Phase 2 of the coverage repair plan, which focuses on enhancing the static analyzer and debug hook components of the coverage module.

## 1. Static Analyzer Improvements

### Line Classification System
- [✓] Refine the `is_line_executable` function
- [✓] Enhance multiline comment detection integration
- [✓] Improve handling of mixed code and comments
- [✓] Add support for additional Lua constructs
- [✓] Create comprehensive tests

**Status**: Significant progress. Implemented improvements to the line classification system, including enhanced multiline comment detection, better handling of control flow keywords, and better string detection. Created comprehensive test suite for line classification with tests for various code constructs. Some edge cases remain to be addressed.

### Function Detection Accuracy
- [✓] Enhance function name extraction logic
- [✓] Improve tracking of anonymous functions
- [✓] Better handle methods in table definitions
- [✓] Create proper function scope boundaries
- [✓] Add function metadata collection

**Status**: Significant progress. Implemented enhanced function detection with better name extraction, improved method detection using colon syntax, and added function type classification (global, local, method, module). Added support for function parameter extraction and line boundary detection. Created comprehensive test suite for function detection. Some edge cases with deeply nested functions and complex method chains remain to be addressed.

### Block Boundary Identification
- [✓] Implement stack-based block tracking system
- [✓] Accurately identify start/end positions for all block types
- [✓] Create proper parent-child relationships
- [✓] Handle complex nested structures
- [✓] Add block metadata for reporting

**Status**: Implemented. Created a comprehensive stack-based block tracking system that accurately identifies all Lua block types (if-else, loops, functions, etc.) and establishes proper parent-child relationships between blocks. Added detailed metadata for each block and enhanced the AST traversal algorithm to handle complex nested structures. Block-level coverage tracking should now be much more accurate.

### Condition Expression Tracking
- [✓] Enhance condition expression detection
- [✓] Decompose compound conditions
- [✓] Track condition outcomes (true/false)
- [✓] Connect conditions to blocks
- [✓] Add condition complexity analysis

**Status**: Implemented. Created a comprehensive condition expression tracking system that identifies and extracts conditions from all control structures (if, while, repeat, for), decomposes compound conditions (and, or) into their components, and establishes parent-child relationships between composite conditions and their parts. Added tracking for condition outcomes (true/false paths) and execution counts, and integrated conditions with their containing blocks. Added detailed metrics for condition coverage, including by condition type and complexity.

## 2. Debug Hook Enhancements

### Data Collection and Representation
- [✓] Improve line execution data collection
- [✓] Enhance block execution tracking
- [✓] Fix function execution tracking
- [✓] Implement condition outcome tracking
- [✓] Create more efficient data structures

**Status**: Implemented. Enhanced the debug hook with comprehensive condition tracking that integrates with the static analyzer's condition expression detection. Implemented accurate tracking of condition outcomes for compound conditions (AND, OR, NOT), ensuring proper parent-child relationships between conditions. Created more efficient data structures with clear separation between execution and coverage data. Added detailed metadata for blocks and conditions, including execution counts and timestamps.

### Execution vs. Coverage Distinction
- [✓] Clarify distinction between executed and covered lines
- [✓] Improve integration with static analyzer
- [✓] Enhance reporting of execution vs. coverage
- [ ] Create visualization for different coverage states
- [✓] Add tests for execution vs. coverage distinction

**Status**: Significant progress. Implemented a clear separation between executed lines (all lines that were executed during tests) and covered lines (executable lines that were executed and validated by tests). Enhanced the data structures to properly distinguish between these concepts, with separate tracking for execution and coverage. Improved integration with the static analyzer to properly determine executability of lines. Added `track_execution()` API for explicitly tracking executed lines without marking them as covered. Created comprehensive tests for verifying the execution vs. coverage distinction. Enhanced reporting to include execution coverage percentage separate from validation coverage percentage.

### Performance Monitoring
- [✓] Add performance instrumentation
- [✓] Create benchmarks for key operations
- [✓] Optimize high-impact code paths
- [✓] Add timeout protection for long operations
- [✓] Implement memory usage tracking

**Status**: Completed. Implemented comprehensive performance tracking in the debug hook, measuring execution time, call counts, and error rates. Added detailed metrics for different event types (line, call, return). Optimized the debug hook to minimize performance impact by reducing redundant operations and adding caching. Added early exit paths for common scenarios to improve performance. Created public API for accessing performance metrics. Implemented benchmarks to measure the overhead of coverage tracking with different file sizes and complexity. Added memory usage tracking to detect potential memory leaks. The benchmarks still have some issues with temporary file handling, but the functionality is in place.

## 3. Testing

### Static Analyzer Test Suite
- [✓] Create error handling tests for static analyzer
- [✓] Implement tests for line classification
- [✓] Add tests for function detection
- [✓] Create tests for block boundary identification
- [✓] Add tests for condition expression tracking

**Status**: Basic test structure implemented. Tests reveal current limitations that need to be addressed.

### Execution vs. Coverage Tests
- [✓] Create tests showing the distinction
- [✓] Add tests for mixed execution states
- [✓] Test corner cases and edge scenarios
- [ ] Implement visual tests for reporting
- [✓] Add regression tests for known issues

**Status**: Completed. Created a comprehensive test suite that verifies:
1. Proper initialization of execution tracking
2. Accurate distinction between executed and covered lines
3. Correct behavior of new APIs like track_execution()
4. Handling of non-executable lines
5. Proper behavior with different API combinations
6. Accurate reporting of execution vs. coverage data

### Performance Benchmarks
- [✓] Create baseline performance measurements
- [✓] Benchmark with various codebase sizes
- [✓] Test performance with complex code structures
- [✓] Measure memory usage patterns
- [✓] Create performance regression tests

**Status**: Implemented. Created benchmarks for measuring:
1. Coverage tracking overhead for small, medium, and large files
2. Performance impact of tracking complex conditions
3. Memory usage during coverage tracking
4. Performance with multiple files
5. Metrics for execution time, memory usage, and call counts

The benchmark tests are implemented but currently have some issues with temporary file handling that need to be addressed. The core functionality is in place and ready for final adjustments.

## Current Focus

The current focus is on completing Phase 2 and preparing for the transition to Phase 3: Reporting & Visualization. The key goal is to visually represent the distinction between execution and coverage in reports.

1. HTML Formatter Enhancements:
   - Create visual distinction between executed and covered code
   - Implement color coding for the four states (non-executable, not executed, executed, covered)
   - Add execution count display in the HTML report

2. Report Validation:
   - Ensure reports correctly display the execution vs. coverage distinction
   - Validate that the metrics are consistent with actual coverage data
   - Implement tests for the enhanced reporting system

## Next Steps

1. Phase 3 Preparation:
   - Enhance HTML formatter to display execution vs. coverage distinction visually
   - Implement hover tooltips for execution counts
   - Create collapsible views for large files
   - Add filtering capabilities to show only executed-but-not-covered code

2. Finalize Performance Improvements:
   - Fix temporary file handling in benchmark tests
   - Optimize coverage data processing for large codebases
   - Create reference performance metrics for different codebase sizes

3. Update Documentation:
   - Document the distinction between execution and coverage
   - Create examples showing how to improve test quality by looking at executed-but-not-covered code
   - Update API documentation for new functions
