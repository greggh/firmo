# Phase 2 Progress: Static Analysis & Debug Hook Enhancements

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of Phase 2 of the coverage repair plan, which focuses on enhancing the static analyzer and debug hook components of the coverage module.

## 1. Static Analyzer Improvements

### Line Classification System
- [✓] Refine the `is_line_executable` function
- [✓] Enhance multiline comment detection integration
- [✓] Improve handling of mixed code and comments
- [✓] Add support for additional Lua constructs
- [✓] Create comprehensive tests

**Status**: Significant progress. Implemented improvements to the line classification system, including enhanced multiline comment detection, better handling of control flow keywords, and better string detection. Created comprehensive test suite for line classification with tests for various code constructs. Some edge cases remain to be addressed.

### Function Detection Accuracy
- [✓] Enhance function name extraction logic
- [✓] Improve tracking of anonymous functions
- [✓] Better handle methods in table definitions
- [✓] Create proper function scope boundaries
- [✓] Add function metadata collection

**Status**: Significant progress. Implemented enhanced function detection with better name extraction, improved method detection using colon syntax, and added function type classification (global, local, method, module). Added support for function parameter extraction and line boundary detection. Created comprehensive test suite for function detection. Some edge cases with deeply nested functions and complex method chains remain to be addressed.

### Block Boundary Identification
- [✓] Implement stack-based block tracking system
- [✓] Accurately identify start/end positions for all block types
- [✓] Create proper parent-child relationships
- [✓] Handle complex nested structures
- [✓] Add block metadata for reporting

**Status**: Implemented. Created a comprehensive stack-based block tracking system that accurately identifies all Lua block types (if-else, loops, functions, etc.) and establishes proper parent-child relationships between blocks. Added detailed metadata for each block and enhanced the AST traversal algorithm to handle complex nested structures. Block-level coverage tracking should now be much more accurate.

### Condition Expression Tracking
- [✓] Enhance condition expression detection
- [✓] Decompose compound conditions
- [✓] Track condition outcomes (true/false)
- [✓] Connect conditions to blocks
- [✓] Add condition complexity analysis

**Status**: Implemented. Created a comprehensive condition expression tracking system that identifies and extracts conditions from all control structures (if, while, repeat, for), decomposes compound conditions (and, or) into their components, and establishes parent-child relationships between composite conditions and their parts. Added tracking for condition outcomes (true/false paths) and execution counts, and integrated conditions with their containing blocks. Added detailed metrics for condition coverage, including by condition type and complexity.

## 2. Debug Hook Enhancements

### Data Collection and Representation
- [ ] Improve line execution data collection
- [ ] Enhance block execution tracking
- [ ] Fix function execution tracking
- [ ] Implement condition outcome tracking
- [ ] Create more efficient data structures

**Status**: Not started.

### Execution vs. Coverage Distinction
- [ ] Clarify distinction between executed and covered lines
- [ ] Improve integration with static analyzer
- [ ] Enhance reporting of execution vs. coverage
- [ ] Create visualization for different coverage states
- [ ] Add tests for execution vs. coverage distinction

**Status**: Not started.

### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Add performance instrumentation
- [ ] Create benchmarks for key operations
- [ ] Optimize high-impact code paths
- [ ] Add timeout protection for long operations
- [ ] Implement memory usage tracking

**Status**: Not started.

## 3. Testing

### Static Analyzer Test Suite
- [✓] Create error handling tests for static analyzer
- [✓] Implement tests for line classification
- [✓] Add tests for function detection
- [✓] Create tests for block boundary identification
- [✓] Add tests for condition expression tracking

**Status**: Basic test structure implemented. Tests reveal current limitations that need to be addressed.

### Execution vs. Coverage Tests
- [ ] Create tests showing the distinction
- [ ] Add tests for mixed execution states
- [ ] Test corner cases and edge scenarios
- [ ] Implement visual tests for reporting
- [ ] Add regression tests for known issues

**Status**: Not started.

### Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] Create baseline performance measurements
- [ ] Benchmark with various codebase sizes
- [ ] Test performance with complex code structures
- [ ] Measure memory usage patterns
- [ ] Create performance regression tests

**Status**: Not started.

## Current Focus
