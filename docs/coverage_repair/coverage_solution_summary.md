# Firmo Coverage Module Solution Summary

## Decision to Rebuild Coverage System

After extensive analysis and multiple debugging attempts, we've determined that the current coverage implementation has fundamental architectural flaws that cannot be resolved with incremental fixes. We are proceeding with a **complete rebuild** of the coverage system.

## Key Architectural Problems

1. **Inconsistent Data Structures**: The system uses multiple incompatible ways of tracking coverage (booleans vs tables vs line counts), leading to confusion in how line execution is represented.

2. **Path Normalization Issues**: File paths are handled inconsistently throughout the system. In some places, paths are normalized using one approach, and in others using different approaches, leading to mismatches when trying to retrieve data.

3. **Source Code Management**: Source code content is not consistently associated with the execution data, making it difficult to generate accurate reports.

4. **Execution Tracking Reliability**: The debug hook implementation doesn't reliably capture all line executions and has issues with how this data is stored and processed.

5. **Report Data Mismatches**: The data structure expected by the HTML formatter doesn't match what's being produced by the coverage tracking system.

6. **Architectural Complexity**: The attempt to support both debug hook and instrumentation approaches simultaneously has led to increased complexity without clear boundaries between the two approaches.

## Rebuild Approach

Rather than attempting to repair the existing implementation, we will:

1. **Start Fresh**: Create a new implementation with a clean, consistent architecture
2. **Simplify**: Focus on getting core functionality working perfectly before adding advanced features
3. **Standardize**: Use a single, clear data structure throughout the system
4. **Test-Driven**: Build comprehensive tests alongside each component
5. **Focus**: Perfect the debug hook approach first, before considering instrumentation

## Expected Benefits

1. **Reliability**: A clean implementation that accurately tracks code execution
2. **Maintainability**: Clear component boundaries and consistent data structures
3. **Accuracy**: Reports that correctly represent which code was executed
4. **Extensibility**: A solid foundation for adding advanced features
5. **Diagnostics**: Built-in tools to validate and visualize coverage data

## Timeline

We'll follow a phased approach, as detailed in the [Coverage Rebuild Plan](coverage_rebuild_plan.md), with an estimated timeline of 4 weeks to build a fully functional replacement system.

## First Step

Our immediate focus will be on designing the core data structure and building a minimal, reliable debug hook implementation that can accurately track line executions. We will be using test-driven development to ensure each component works correctly before moving to the next.
