# Session Summary Documentation

## Overview

Session summaries are important documentation that capture the work done during each session on the lust-next coverage module repair project. They provide a record of what was accomplished, what issues were encountered, and what tasks remain.

## Location

Session summaries should be stored in the dedicated subdirectory at:
`/home/gregg/Projects/lua-library/lust-next/docs/coverage_repair/session_summaries/`

## Naming Convention

Session summary files should be named using the following format:
`session_summary_YYYY-MM-DD_topic.md`

Where:
- `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date of the session (e.g., 2025-03-11)
- `topic` is a brief description of the main work done in the session

For example:
- `session_summary_2025-03-11_error_handling.md`
- `session_summary_2025-03-11_instrumentation_fixes.md`

## Content Structure

Each session summary should include:

1. **Title**: A clear title describing the session's focus
2. **Date**: The date of the session (March 11, 2025 format)
3. **Issues Addressed**: Description of the issues tackled during the session
4. **Solutions Implemented**: Details of the fixes or improvements made
5. **Code Changes**: Summary of significant code modifications
6. **Test Results**: Summary of any tests run and their results
7. **Issues Discovered**: Any new issues found during the session
8. **Next Steps**: Recommendations for future sessions

## Example Template

```markdown
# Session Summary: [Topic] (March 11, 2025)

This document summarizes the work done on [specific topic] during today's session.

## Issues Addressed

1. **[Issue Title]**:
   - Description of the issue
   - Root cause analysis

2. **[Another Issue]**:
   - Description of the issue

1. **[Solution Title]**:
   - Description of the approach
   - Key implementation details
   ```lua
   -- Example code snippet if relevant
   ```

2. **[Another Solution]**:

   - Any issues discovered

## Issues Discovered

1. **[New Issue]**:
   - Description of the new issue
   - Potential approaches for resolution

## Next Steps

```

## Integration with Other Documentation

Session summaries should be referenced in:

1. **Phase Progress Files**: When documenting completed tasks
2. **Next Steps**: When planning future sessions
3. **Test Results**: When documenting test outcomes

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Include specific file names, function names, and line numbers
2. **Include Code Snippets**: Add relevant code snippets for clarity
3. **Focus on Root Causes**: Document the root causes of issues, not just symptoms
4. **Document Architectural Decisions**: Capture any significant architectural decisions
5. **Include All Issues**: Document both resolved and unresolved issues

## Maintenance

Session summaries should be preserved for historical reference. While they may contain some redundant information, they provide valuable context about the evolution of the project.
