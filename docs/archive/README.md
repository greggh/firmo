This directory contains historical planning and implementation documents for the firmo project. These files are kept for reference purposes but have been superseded by the formal documentation in the docs directory.

## Files

- **coverage_fixes_summary.md**: Summary of critical issues fixed in the coverage module
- **coverage_module_plan.md**: Original implementation plan for the coverage module

- **logging_features_summary.md**: List of implemented logging features
- **logging_implementation_report.md**: Implementation report for the centralized logging system
- **firmo.lua.original**: Original version of firmo before modifications

## Note

These files are archived because:
1. Their content has been incorporated into formal documentation
2. The implementation work they describe has been completed
3. They no longer reflect the current state of the project

Please refer to the main docs directory for up-to-date documentation.
