# lust-next Mocking System Implementation Summary

## Accomplishments

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive mocking system for lust-next with the following components:

1. **Modular Design**:
   - Created separate modules for spy, stub, and mock functionality
   - Implemented a clean, maintainable architecture
   - Added proper error handling and validation

2. **Spy Functionality** (Highest Priority):
   - Implemented function call tracking with arguments
   - Added `called_with()` verification method
   - Implemented call count verification methods
   - Created last call retrieval functionality
   - Developed call sequence tracking

3. **Stub Functionality**:
   - Created simple value stub implementation
   - Implemented function stub capability
   - Added `returns()` method for value configuration
   - Added `throws()` method for error simulation

4. **Mock Functionality**:
   - Implemented object method stubbing
   - Added verification capabilities
   - Created automatic mock restoration

5. **Context Management**:
   - Enhanced the `with_mocks` context manager
   - Added robust error handling
   - Ensured proper cleanup even when errors occur

## Testing

All functionality has been thoroughly tested with:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Comprehensive unit tests for each module
   - Standalone test files that verify each feature

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Tests that verify the modules work together
   - Simulated lust-next environment for testing

## Implementation Files

The following files contain the implementation:

- `src/spy.lua` - Spy functionality
- `src/stub.lua` - Stub functionality 
- `src/mock.lua` - Mock and context management
- `src/mocking.lua` - Integration module for lust-next
- `test_spy.lua` - Basic tests for spy module
- `test_mocking_system.lua` - Comprehensive tests
- `lust_next_integration.lua` - Integration tests
- `MOCKING_SYSTEM.md` - Implementation plan

## Completed Work

1. **Integration with lust-next.lua**:
   - Replaced the existing mocking implementation with modular design
   - Ensured backward compatibility with existing test code
   - Maintained API structure while enhancing capabilities

2. **Documentation and Examples**:
   - Updated user-facing documentation in docs/api/mocking.md
   - Created comprehensive examples:
     - `examples/mocking_example.lua` - Basic mocking functionality
     - `examples/mock_sequence_example.lua` - Call sequence verification
     - `examples/mock_sequence_returns_example.lua` - Sequential return values
     - `examples/enhanced_mock_sequence_example.lua` - Advanced sequence features

3. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Implemented sequential return values with `returns_in_sequence()`
   - Added multiple sequence exhaustion behaviors
   - Created sequence reset functionality
   - Enhanced call sequence verification
   - Improved error messaging and diagnostics

## Next Steps

1. **Additional Features**:
   - Enhanced argument matchers
   - Complete expectation API implementation
   - More advanced verification capabilities

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize memory usage during test runs
   - Improve cleanup processes for large test suites

## Conclusion

The modular mocking system provides a robust foundation for testing with lust-next. The implementation follows best practices, includes comprehensive error handling, and maintains backward compatibility while adding powerful new features.
