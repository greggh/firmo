# Coverage Improvement Plan for lust-next

## Current Status

The coverage module is showing inconsistent results when run on our main codebase. Some of the issues identified:

1. Files with 0% coverage are not being properly detected
2. The coverage percentage calculation is inconsistent
3. Coverage thresholds are not being properly applied

## Action Plan

1. **Fix Coverage Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Fix the coverage module to properly detect and report files with 0% coverage
   - Ensure coverage percentage calculations are accurate
   - Verify coverage thresholds are being applied correctly

2. **Prioritize Core Modules**:
   - Focus on improving test coverage for these key modules:
     - lib/core/
     - lib/coverage/
     - lib/quality/
     - lib/reporting/
     - lib/mocking/

3. **Implement Additional Tests**:
   - Create focused tests for each module with low coverage
   - Ensure edge cases are properly tested
   - Verify configuration options are tested

4. **Improve Test Structure**:
   - Organize tests to match the module structure
   - Ensure tests are properly isolated
   - Use module reset functionality to prevent test contamination

5. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test interactions between modules
   - Verify end-to-end functionality
   - Test real-world scenarios

## Critical Components Needing Coverage

1. **Core Module**:
   - config.lua (new file requiring thorough testing)
   - fix_expect.lua (complex assertion handling)
   - module_reset.lua (important for test isolation)
   - type_checking.lua (fundamental for many assertions)

2. **Coverage Module**:
   - Ensure calculation of coverage statistics is accurate
   - Test handling of 0% coverage files
   - Verify threshold checking

3. **Quality Module**:
   - Test validation of quality levels
   - Verify integration with coverage module
   - Test quality reporting functionality

4. **Reporting Module**:
   - Test all formatters (HTML, JSON, TAP, CSV, JUnit, LCOV)
   - Verify report generation and file saving
   - Test integration with coverage and quality modules

## Goal

Achieve at least 90% test coverage across the entire codebase, with particular emphasis on core functionality.
