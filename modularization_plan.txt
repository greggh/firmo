1. The main firmo.lua file should import the following extracted modules:
- lib/core/test_definition.lua: For test block definitions (describe/it)
- lib/tools/cli.lua: For CLI argument parsing and command execution
- lib/tools/discover.lua: For test file discovery
- lib/core/runner.lua: For test execution

2. The main file should then:
- Import all modules
- Forward the functions from the modules to maintain the public API
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Reduce its code size by delegating to the modules

3. Next steps:
- Create tests to verify the new modular architecture works as expected
- Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
