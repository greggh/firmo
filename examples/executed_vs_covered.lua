  executed_vs_covered.lua
  
  An example demonstrating the distinction between code execution and test coverage.
  This shows how the lust-next coverage module can track both:
  
  1. Code that is executed (regardless of test validation)
  2. Code that is covered (executed AND validated by test assertions)
