# Project: lust-next

## Overview
lust-next is an enhanced Lua testing framework that provides comprehensive testing capabilities for Lua projects. It features BDD-style nested test blocks, assertions with detailed error messages, setup/teardown hooks, advanced mocking, tagging, asynchronous testing, code coverage analysis, and test quality validation.

## Current Focus - Filesystem Module Integration Complete
We've completed the implementation and integration of our new filesystem module:

1. **Created Standalone Filesystem Module**:
   - Implemented comprehensive filesystem.lua module in lib/tools
   - Created platform-independent file and directory operations
   - Built robust error handling with consistent return values
   - Added path manipulation utilities for cross-platform compatibility
   - Implemented file discovery with glob pattern support
   - Created detailed documentation and examples

2. **Integrated with Coverage and Quality Modules**:
   - Refactored coverage module to use the filesystem module for file operations
   - Updated file discovery in coverage using filesystem's robust discover_files function
   - Updated quality module to use filesystem for file reading and report generation
   - Removed duplicate file handling code, centralizing all file operations
   - Created example files demonstrating the integration

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Complete comprehensive test suite for filesystem module
   - Enhance the test coverage of the integration points
   - Run higher-level code quality validation (level 5) to identify weak spots
   - Extract filesystem module to its own library when mature
   - Complete integration with hooks-util project

We have made significant progress with the coverage infrastructure, fixing all integration tests and enhancing the coverage module with better file discovery capabilities. Our next major initiative is to implement a standalone filesystem module that can eventually be extracted to its own library.

## Working Environment Setup
We've implemented the interactive CLI mode for lust-next:

- Interactive CLI mode for running tests: ✅
  - [x] Full-featured interactive command-line interface
  - [x] Live configuration of test options (tags, filters, focus)
  - [x] Command history and navigation
  - [x] Dynamic test discovery and execution
  - [x] Status display showing current configuration
  - [x] Toggle watch mode from within the interface
  - [x] Integration with codefix module for code quality checks
  - [x] Comprehensive help system with command reference
  - [x] Clear, colorized output for better readability
  - [x] Example script demonstrating interactive mode usage
We've previously completed these major features:

- Fixed expect assertion system: ✅
  - [x] Fixed issues with expect assertion chains
  - [x] Added proper test coverage for all assertion types
  - [x] Corrected path definitions for assertion methods
  - [x] Ensured reset() function preserves assertion paths
  - [x] Added comprehensive test suite for expect assertions
- Watch mode for continuous testing: ✅
  - [x] Automatic file change detection
  - [x] Continuous test execution
  - [x] Configurable directories to watch
  - [x] Exclusion patterns for ignoring files
  - [x] Debounce mechanism to prevent multiple runs on rapid changes
  - [x] Integration with interactive CLI mode

## Future Focus

- All planned features from our testing plan have been implemented:
  - ✅ TAP output format support for broader testing ecosystem integration
  - ✅ CSV output format for spreadsheet and data analysis integration
  - ✅ Command-line configuration for report file naming and paths
  - ✅ Runtime configuration options for custom test output formats
  - ✅ Improved test suite isolation with module reset system
  - ✅ Benchmarking tools for performance analysis
  - ✅ Memory usage tracking and optimization
  - ✅ Parallel test execution across multiple processes
  - ✅ Results aggregation from parallel test runs
  - ✅ Coverage data merging from multiple processes
  - ✅ Configuration file system for customizing defaults (.lust-next-config.lua)
- Current focus - Integration with hooks-util and markdown tools:
  - Create integration tests with hooks-util
  - Develop comprehensive integration tests for markdown processing tools
  - Document integration patterns for custom projects
  - Create comprehensive examples for various integration scenarios
- Potential future enhancements:
  - Code coverage visualization improvements for complex codebases
  - Additional specialized formatters for specific CI/CD pipelines
  - Stream-based test result processing for extremely large test suites
  - Distributed test execution across multiple machines
